=== How-to use that template project

You need to change "BLANK" in filenames and file content by your actual project name:


Filename:

```
for i in **/BLANK; do mv $i $(dirname $i)/mypluginuniqueshortname; done
sed -i -e "s/BLANK/mypluginuniqueshortname/g"

```

Then, you still have several file with name containing BLANK to update.
Most of them can be renamed with the `mypluginuniqueshortname` (or a
capatalize version of it).

```
ls **/BLANK*
```
