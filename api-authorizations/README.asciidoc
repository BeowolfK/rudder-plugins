=== Synopsis

This plugin provides fine grained Access Control List on APIs.
It also allows registered Rudder users to get private token with the same
rights as their role allows.

=== Logging

You can log information about ACL (behavior and errors) by adding the following lines in your ```logback.xml``` file:


```

  <!--
      API ACLs
      ========
      Information about ALC evalutation for APIs.

      This logger allows to get extra information about API
      ACLs resolution.

   -->
  <logger name="api-acl" level="off" />
```
