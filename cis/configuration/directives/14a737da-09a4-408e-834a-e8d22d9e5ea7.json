  "longDescription": "Description:\nAvahi is a free zeroconf implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD\nservice discovery. Avahi allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts\nrunning on a local network with no specific configuration. For example, a user can plug a\ncomputer into a network and Avahi automatically finds printers to print to, files to look at\nand people to talk to, as well as network services running on the machine.\nRationale:\nAutomatic discovery of network services is not normally required for system functionality.\nIt is recommended to disable the service to reduce the potential attack surface.",
