  "longDescription": "Description:\nMonitor the sudo log file. If the system has been properly configured to disable the use of\nthe su command and force all administrators to have to log in first and then use sudo to\nexecute privileged commands, then all administrator commands will be logged to\n/var/log/sudo.log . Any time a command is executed, an audit event will be triggered as\nthe /var/log/sudo.log file will be opened for write and the executed administration\ncommand will be written to the log.\nRationale:\nChanges in /var/log/sudo.log indicate that an administrator has executed a command or\nthe log file itself has been tampered with. Administrators will want to correlate the events\nwritten to the audit trail with the records written to /var/log/sudo.log to verify if\nunauthorized commands have been executed.",
