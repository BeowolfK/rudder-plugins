  "longDescription": "Description:\nThe /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users\nand some applications.\nRationale:\nSince the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource\nexhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file\nsystem allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless\nfor an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from\nestablishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the\nprogram was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own\ncopy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker\ncould continue to exploit the known flaw.",
