  "longDescription": "Description:\nThe Network Information Service (NIS) (formally known as Yellow Pages) is a client-server\ndirectory service protocol for distributing system configuration files. The NIS server is a\ncollection of programs that allow for the distribution of configuration files.\nRationale:\nThe NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable to DOS attacks,\nbuffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying NIS maps. NIS generally been\nreplaced by such protocols as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is\nrecommended that the service be disabled and other, more secure services be used",
