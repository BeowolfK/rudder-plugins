  "longDescription": "Description:\nThe Common Unix Print System (CUPS) provides the ability to print to both local and\nnetwork printers. A system running CUPS can also accept print jobs from remote systems\nand print them to local printers. It also provides a web based remote administration\ncapability.\nRationale:\nIf the system does not need to print jobs or accept print jobs from other systems, it is\nrecommended that CUPS be disabled to reduce the potential attack surface.",
