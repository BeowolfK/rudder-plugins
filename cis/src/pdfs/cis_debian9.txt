Overview
This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration
posture for Debian Linux 9 systems running on x86 and x64 platforms.
Many lists are included including filesystem types, services, clients, and network protocols.
Not all items in these lists are guaranteed to exist on all distributions and additional similar
items may exist which should be considered in addition to those explicitly mentioned.
The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the root user.
Operations performed using sudo instead of the root user may produce unexpected results,
or fail to make the intended changes to the system. Non-root users may not be able to
access certain areas of the system, especially after remediation has been performed. It is
advisable to verify root users path integrity and the integrity of any programs being run
prior to execution of commands and scripts included in this benchmark.
To obtain the latest version of this guide, please visit http://workbench.cisecurity.org. If
you have questions, comments, or have identified ways to improve this guide, please write
us at feedback@cisecurity.org.

Intended Audience
This benchmark is intended for system and application administrators, security specialists,
auditors, help desk, and platform deployment personnel who plan to develop, deploy,
assess, or secure solutions that incorporate Debian Linux 9 on a x86 or x64 platform.

Consensus Guidance
This benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of subject
matter experts. Consensus participants provide perspective from a diverse set of
backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and compliance, security
research, operations, government, and legal.
Each CIS benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase occurs
during initial benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts convene
to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the benchmark. This discussion occurs until
consensus has been reached on benchmark recommendations. The second phase begins
after the benchmark has been published. During this phase, all feedback provided by the
Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for incorporation in the

12 | P a g e

benchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus process, please visit

Recommendations

17 | P a g e

1 Initial Setup
Items in this section are advised for all systems, but may be difficult or require extensive
preparation after the initial setup of the system.

18 | P a g e

1.1 Filesystem Configuration
Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing
them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables
the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data
can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a
filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for
system operations.
The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system
installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be
performed before repartitioning the system.
Note: If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data
has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the
directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old
partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system
is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data
to the /tmp directory, this data will still consume space in / once the /tmp filesystem is
mounted unless it is removed first.

19 | P a g e

1.1.1 Disable unused filesystems
A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for
unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem
type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure
that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to
unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should
be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not
maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of
non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them,
especially in light of frequent operating system changes.
Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of
non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less
attractive.
Note: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of filesystems. You may wish to
consider additions to those listed here for your environment.

1.1.2 Ensure /tmp is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users
and some applications.
Rationale:
Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the
mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also
prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it
to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the
attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a
security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.
This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate
partition for /tmp.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output shows /tmp is mounted:
# mount | grep /tmp
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

run the following command and verify that tmpfs has been mounted to, or a system
partition has been created for /tmp
# systemctl is-enabled tmp.mount
enabled

28 | P a g e

Remediation:
Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.
example:
tmpfs
/tmp

tmpfs

defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime

0 0

or
Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting:
systemctl unmask tmp.mount
systemctl enable tmp.mount

Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp
mount:
[Mount]
What=tmpfs
Where=/tmp
Type=tmpfs
Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid

Impact:
Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource
exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.
Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it,
but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available,
as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs
will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the
filesystem much more easily.
/tmp utalizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter on the Options line on
the tmp.mount file

Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store
dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable.
Rationale:
Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of
resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output shows /var is mounted:
# mount | grep /var
/dev/xvdg1 on /var type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Setting the sticky bit on world writable directories prevents users from deleting or
renaming files in that directory that are not owned by them.
Rationale:
This feature prevents the ability to delete or rename files in world writable directories
(such as /tmp ) that are owned by another user.

1.1.22 Disable Automounting (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
autofs allows automatic mounting of devices, typically including CD/DVDs and USB drives.

Rationale:
With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a USB drive or disc
and have its contents available in system even if they lacked permissions to mount it
themselves.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify autofs is not enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled autofs
disabled

Verify result is not "enabled".

61 | P a g e

Remediation:
Run the following command to disable autofs:
# systemctl disable autofs

Impact:
The use portable hard drives is very common for workstation users. If your organization
allows the use of portable storage or media on workstations and physical access controls to
workstations is considered adequate there is little value add in turning off automounting.
Notes:
This control should align with the tolerance of the use of portable drives and optical media
in the organization. On a server requiring an admin to manually mount media can be part
of defense-in-depth to reduce the risk of unapproved software or information being
introduced or proprietary software or information being exfiltrated. If admins commonly
use flash drives and Server access has sufficient physical controls, requiring manual
mounting may not increase security.

1.2 Configure Software Updates
Debian Linux uses apt to install and update software packages. Patch management
procedures may vary widely between enterprises. Large enterprises may choose to install a
local updates server that can be used in place of Debian's servers, whereas a single
deployment of a system may prefer to get updates directly. Updates can be performed
automatically or manually, depending on the site's policy for patch management. Many
large enterprises prefer to test patches on a non-production system before rolling out to
production.
For the purpose of this benchmark, the requirement is to ensure that a patch management
system is configured and maintained. The specifics on patch update procedures are left to

1.3 Filesystem Integrity Checking
AIDE is a file integrity checking tool, similar in nature to Tripwire. While it cannot prevent
intrusions, it can detect unauthorized changes to configuration files by alerting when the
files are changed. When setting up AIDE, decide internally what the site policy will be
concerning integrity checking. Review the AIDE quick start guide and AIDE documentation
before proceeding.

66 | P a g e

1.3.1 Ensure AIDE is installed (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
AIDE takes a snapshot of filesystem state including modification times, permissions, and
file hashes which can then be used to compare against the current state of the filesystem to
detect modifications to the system.
Rationale:
By monitoring the filesystem state compromised files can be detected to prevent or limit
the exposure of accidental or malicious misconfigurations or modified binaries.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify AIDE is installed:
# dpkg -s aide

67 | P a g e

Remediation:
Run the following command to install AIDE:
# apt-get install aide aide-common

Configure AIDE as appropriate for your environment. Consult the AIDE documentation for
options.
Initialize AIDE:
# aideinit

References:

The prelinking feature can interfere with AIDE because it alters binaries to speed up their
start up times. Run prelink -ua to restore the binaries to their prelinked state, thus
avoiding false positives from AIDE.

1.3.2 Ensure filesystem integrity is regularly checked (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Periodic checking of the filesystem integrity is needed to detect changes to the filesystem.
Rationale:
Periodic file checking allows the system administrator to determine on a regular basis if
critical files have been changed in an unauthorized fashion.
Audit:
Run the following commands to determine if there is a cron job scheduled to run the aide
check.
# crontab -u root -l | grep aide
# grep -r aide /etc/cron.* /etc/crontab

Ensure a cron job in compliance with site policy is returned.

Notes:
The checking in this recommendation occurs every day at 5am. Alter the frequency and
time of the checks in compliance with site policy.

1.4 Secure Boot Settings
The recommendations in this section focus on securing the bootloader and settings
involved in the boot process directly.

71 | P a g e

1.4.1 Ensure permissions on bootloader config are configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The grub configuration file contains information on boot settings and passwords for
unlocking boot options. The grub configuration is usually grub.cfg stored in /boot/grub.
Rationale:
Setting the permissions to read and write for root only prevents non-root users from
seeing the boot parameters or changing them. Non-root users who read the boot
parameters may be able to identify weaknesses in security upon boot and be able to exploit
them.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access does not
grant permissions to group or other:
# stat /boot/grub/grub.cfg
Access: (0600/-rw-------) Uid: (

0/

root)

Gid: (

0/

1.4.2 Ensure bootloader password is set (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter
a password before being able to set command line boot parameters
Rationale:
Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized
user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users
from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time).
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# grep "^set superusers" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
set superusers="<username>"
# grep "^password" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>

74 | P a g e

Remediation:
Create an encrypted password with grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2:
# grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
Enter password: <password>
Reenter password: <password>
Your PBKDF2 is <encrypted-password>

Add the following into /etc/grub.d/00_header or a custom /etc/grub.d configuration file:
cat <<EOF
set superusers="<username>"
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>
EOF

If there is a requirement to be able to boot/reboot without entering the password, edit
/etc/grub.d/10_linux and add --unrestricted to the line CLASS=
Example:
CLASS="--class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os --unrestricted"

Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:
# update-grub

Impact:
If password protection is enabled, only the designated superuser can edit a Grub 2 menu
item by pressing "e" or access the GRUB 2 command line by pressing "c"
If GRUB 2 is set up to boot automatically to a password-protected menu entry the user has
no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu entry. Holding the
SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username
and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or
other means to fix the problem
You can add --unrestricted to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without
entering a password. Password will still be required to edit menu items.

1.5.1 Ensure core dumps are restricted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine
why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core
file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be
overridden by the user.
Rationale:
Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core
dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5) ). In
addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from
dumping core.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# grep "hard core" /etc/security/limits.conf /etc/security/limits.d/*
* hard core 0
# sysctl fs.suid_dumpable
fs.suid_dumpable = 0
# grep "fs\.suid_dumpable" /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*

1.5.2 Ensure XD/NX support is enabled (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per
memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute
(NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help
prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever
possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on
32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such
support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature.
Rationale:
Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security
of the system.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify your kernel has identified and activated NX/XD
protection.
# dmesg | grep NX
NX (Execute Disable) protection: active

81 | P a g e

Remediation:
On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit
systems:
If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system.
You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios.
Notes:
Ensure your system supports the XD or NX bit and has PAE support before implementing
this recommendation as this may prevent it from booting if these are not supported by
your hardware.

1.6 Mandatory Access Control
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provides an additional layer of access restrictions to
processes on top of the base Discretionary Access Controls. By restricting how processes
can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the
processes can be reduced.
Impact: Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a
system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be
complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring.
Note: Apparmor is the default MAC provided with Debian systems.

86 | P a g e

1.6.1 Configure SELinux
SELinux provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the
default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under SELinux, every process and every
object (files, sockets, pipes) on the system is assigned a security context, a label that
includes detailed type information about the object. The kernel allows processes to access
objects only if that access is explicitly allowed by the policy in effect. The policy defines
transitions, so that a user can be allowed to run software, but the software can run under a
different context than the user's default. This automatically limits the damage that the
software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any
action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions
must be satisfied as well as the SELinux MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if either
one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, SELinux rules can only make a
system's permissions more restrictive and secure. SELinux requires a complex policy to
allow all the actions required of a system under normal operation. Three such policies have
been available for use with Debian and are included with the system: default, strict, and
mls. These are described as follows:





default: targeted rules developed and maintained by Debian. Consists mostly of

Type Enforcement (TE) rules, and a small number of Role-Based Access Control
(RBAC) rules. Targeted restricts the actions of many types of programs, but leaves
interactive users largely unaffected.
strict: also uses TE and RBAC rules, but on more programs and more aggressively.
mls: implements Multi-Level Security (MLS), which introduces even more kinds of
labels (sensitivity and category) and rules that govern access based on these.

This section provides guidance for the configuration of the targeted policy.

87 | P a g e

Note: This section only applies if SELinux is in use on the system. Recommendations for
AppArmor are also included, and additional Mandatory Access Control systems exist
beyond these two. AppArmor is the standard MAC system for Debian systems.

Description:
Daemons that are not defined in SELinux policy will inherit the security context of their
parent process.
Rationale:
Since daemons are launched and descend from the init process, they will inherit the
security context label initrc_t. This could cause the unintended consequence of giving the
process more permission than it requires.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify not output is produced:
# ps -eZ | egrep "initrc" | egrep -vw "tr|ps|egrep|bash|awk" | tr ':' ' ' |

95 | P a g e

Remediation:
Investigate any unconfined daemons found during the audit action. They may need to have
an existing security context assigned to them or a policy built for them.

1.6.2 Configure AppArmor
AppArmor provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the
default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under AppArmor MAC rules are applied
by file paths instead of by security contexts as in other MAC systems. As such it does not
require support in the filesystem and can be applied to network mounted filesystems for
example. AppArmor security policies define what system resources applications can access
and what privileges they can do so with. This automatically limits the damage that the
software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any
action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions
must be satisfied as well as the AppArmor MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if
either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, AppArmor rules can only
make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure.
Note: This section only applies if AppArmor is in use on the system. Recommendations for
SELinux are also included, and additional Mandatory Access Control systems exist beyond
these two.

1.7 Warning Banners
Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist in the prosecution
of trespassers on the computer system. Changing some of these login banners also has the
side effect of hiding OS version information and other detailed system information from
attackers attempting to target specific exploits at a system.
Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages
include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system
is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and
that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the
organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system
modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific. More
information (including citations of relevant case law) can be found at
http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/
Note: The text provided in the remediation actions for these items is intended as an
example only. Please edit to include the specific text for your organization as approved by

services that are not required for normal system operation. This prevents the exploitation
of vulnerabilities discovered at a later date. If a service is not enabled, it cannot be
exploited. The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on some services
which can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number
of possible threats to the resulting system. Additionally some services which should remain

2.2.1.1 Ensure time synchronization is in use (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
System time should be synchronized between all systems in an environment. This is
typically done by establishing an authoritative time server or set of servers and having all
systems synchronize their clocks to them.
Rationale:
Time synchronization is important to support time sensitive security mechanisms like
Kerberos and also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise,
which aids in forensic investigations.
Audit:
On physical systems or virtual systems where host based time synchronization is not
available run the following commands and verify either NTP or chrony is installed:
# dpkg -s ntp
# dpkg -s chrony

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to listen for incoming
mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate user or mail server. If the system is not
intended to be a mail server, it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process
local mail.
Rationale:
The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long history of
security issues. While it is important to ensure that the system can process local mail
messages, it is not necessary to have the MTA's daemon listening on a port unless the
server is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that the MTA is not listening on any non-loopback
address ( 127.0.0.1 or ::1 ):
# netstat -an | grep LIST | grep ":25[[:space:]]"
tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:25 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The net.ipv4.ip_forward and net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding flags are used to tell the

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
ICMP Redirects are used to send routing information to other hosts. As a host itself does
not act as a router (in a host only configuration), there is no need to send redirects.
Rationale:
An attacker could use a compromised host to send invalid ICMP redirects to other router

3.2.1 Ensure source routed packets are not accepted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets
take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined
by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from
some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets
would need to be used.
Rationale:
Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route,
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route,
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route and
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from accepting

source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet
routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume
that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice
versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable
addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If,
however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the
private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing
protocols that did not allow this routing.

3.2.2 Ensure ICMP redirects are not accepted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
ICMP redirect messages are packets that convey routing information and tell your host
(acting as a router) to send packets via an alternate path. It is a way of allowing an outside
routing device to update your system routing tables. By setting
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects and net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects to 0,
the system will not accept any ICMP redirect messages, and therefore, won't allow
outsiders to update the system's routing tables.
Rationale:
Attackers could use bogus ICMP redirect messages to maliciously alter the system routing
tables and get them to send packets to incorrect networks and allow your system packets
to be captured.

3.2.5 Ensure broadcast ICMP requests are ignored (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Setting net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts to 1 will cause the system to ignore all
ICMP echo and timestamp requests to broadcast and multicast addresses.
Rationale:
Accepting ICMP echo and timestamp requests with broadcast or multicast destinations for
your network could be used to trick your host into starting (or participating) in a Smurf
attack. A Smurf attack relies on an attacker sending large amounts of ICMP broadcast
messages with a spoofed source address. All hosts receiving this message and responding
would send echo-reply messages back to the spoofed address, which is probably not
routable. If many hosts respond to the packets, the amount of traffic on the network could
be significantly multiplied.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts

3.2.6 Ensure bogus ICMP responses are ignored (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Setting icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses to 1 prevents the kernel from logging bogus
responses (RFC-1122 non-compliant) from broadcast reframes, keeping file systems from
filling up with useless log messages.
Rationale:
Some routers (and some attackers) will send responses that violate RFC-1122 and attempt
to fill up a log file system with many useless error messages.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses

3.2.7 Ensure Reverse Path Filtering is enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter to 1 forces
the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if the
packet was valid. Essentially, with reverse path filtering, if the return packet does not go
out the same interface that the corresponding source packet came from, the packet is
dropped (and logged if log_martians is set).
Rationale:
Setting these flags is a good way to deter attackers from sending your system bogus
packets that cannot be responded to. One instance where this feature breaks down is if
asymmetrical routing is employed. This would occur when using dynamic routing protocols
(bgp, ospf, etc) on your system. If you are using asymmetrical routing on your system, you
will not be able to enable this feature without breaking the routing.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter

3.2.8 Ensure TCP SYN Cookies is enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the
half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN
cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the
SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that
encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet
was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake
with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has
received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no
corresponding SYN in the queue.
Rationale:
Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by
sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake. This will quickly
use up slots in the kernel's half-open connection queue and prevent legitimate connections
from succeeding. SYN cookies allow the system to keep accepting valid connections, even if
under a denial of service attack.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

3.2.9 Ensure IPv6 router advertisements are not accepted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
This setting disables the system's ability to accept IPv6 router advertisements.
Rationale:
It is recommended that systems not accept router advertisements as they could be tricked
into routing traffic to compromised machines. Setting hard routes within the system
(usually a single default route to a trusted router) protects the system from bad routes.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
TCP Wrappers provides a simple access list and standardized logging method for services
capable of supporting it. In the past, services that were called from inetd and xinetd
supported the use of tcp wrappers. As inetd and xinetd have been falling in disuse, any
service that can support tcp wrappers will have the libwrap.so library attached to it.
Rationale:
TCP Wrappers provide a good simple access list mechanism to services that may not have
that support built in. It is recommended that all services that can support TCP Wrappers,
use it.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify TCP Wrappers is installed:
dpkg -s tcpd

189 | P a g e

Remediation:
Run the following command to install TCP Wrappers:
apt-get install tcpd

Description:
The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol is designed to provide
communication between cluster nodes.
Rationale:
If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module not be loaded,
disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
# modprobe -n -v tipc
install /bin/true
# lsmod | grep tipc
<No output>

Remediation:
Edit or create a file in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory ending in .conf

3.5 Firewall Configuration
IPtables is an application that allows a system administrator to configure the IPv4 tables,
IPv6 tables, chains and rules provided by the Linux kernel firewall. While several methods
of configuration exist this section is intended only to ensure the resulting IPtables and rules
are in place, not how they are configured. If IPv6 is in use in your environment, similar
settings should be applied to the IP6tables as well.

200 | P a g e

3.5.1 Configure IPv4 iptables
Iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet filter rules in the
Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of
built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.
Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do
with a packet that matches. This is called a 'target', which may be a jump to a user-defined
chain in the same table.
Note: This section broadly assumes starting with an empty IPtables firewall ruleset
(established by flushing the rules with iptables -F). Remediation steps included only affect
the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to apply
on boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will
often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration
set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run
and tested before saving to boot. The following script will implement the firewall rules of
this section and open port 22(ssh) from anywhere:

3.5.1.1 Ensure default deny firewall policy (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
A default deny all policy on connections ensures that any unconfigured network usage will
be rejected.
Rationale:
With a default accept policy the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be
denied. It is easier to white list acceptable usage than to black list unacceptable usage.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that the policy for the INPUT , OUTPUT , and FORWARD
chains is DROP or REJECT :
# iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
Chain FORWARD (policy DROP)
Chain OUTPUT (policy DROP)

203 | P a g e

Remediation:

Description:
Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic. Configure all other interfaces to deny
traffic to the loopback network (127.0.0.0/8).
Rationale:
Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically critical to
operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network
(127.0.0.0/8) traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this
network as an anti-spoofing measure.

4 Logging and Auditing
The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing,
using tools included in most distributions.
It is recommended that rsyslog be used for logging (with logwatch providing
summarization) and auditd be used for auditing (with aureport providing summarization)
to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.
In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended
that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an
encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that
may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log
information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the
local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it
to process the logs described in this section.
Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems
(particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized
among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol
for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most
network-ready devices. See the ntpd(8) manual page for more information on configuring
NTP.
It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and
correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more
significant when compared to an entry in another log.
Note on log file permissions: There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the
permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who
are in a defined security group do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log
files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group
permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root.

225 | P a g e

4.1 Configure System Accounting (auditd)
System auditing, through auditd, allows system administrators to monitor their systems
such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd
will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication
events. Events will be logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log. The recording of these events
will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are
captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated.
The recommendations in this section implement an audit policy that produces large
quantities of logged data. In some environments it can be challenging to store or process
these logs and as such they are marked as Level 2 for both Servers and Workstations. Note:
For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64
bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.
Note: Once all configuration changes have been made to /etc/audit/audit.rules, the
auditd configuration must be reloaded:
# systemctl reload auditd

226 | P a g e

4.1.1 Configure Data Retention
When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit
logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them.
Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may
fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide
guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements.

4.1.1.1 Ensure audit log storage size is configured (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Configure the maximum size of the audit log file. Once the log reaches the maximum size, it
will be rotated and a new log file will be started.
Rationale:
It is important that an appropriate size is determined for log files so that they do not impact
the system and audit data is not lost.
Audit:
Run the following command and ensure output is in compliance with site policy:
# grep max_log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
max_log_file = <MB>

Remediation:
Set the following parameter in /etc/audit/auditd.conf in accordance with site policy:
max_log_file = <MB>

4.1.1.3 Ensure audit logs are not automatically deleted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The max_log_file_action setting determines how to handle the audit log file reaching the
max file size. A value of keep_logs will rotate the logs but never delete old logs.
Rationale:
In high security contexts, the benefits of maintaining a long audit history exceed the cost of
storing the audit history.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output matches:
# grep max_log_file_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf
max_log_file_action = keep_logs

Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Configure grub so that processes that are capable of being audited can be audited even if
they start up prior to auditd startup.
Rationale:
Audit events need to be captured on processes that start up prior to auditd, so that
potential malicious activity cannot go undetected.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Capture events where the system date and/or time has been modified. The parameters in
this section are set to determine if the adjtimex (tune kernel clock), settimeofday (Set
time, using timeval and timezone structures) stime (using seconds since 1/1/1970) or
clock_settime (allows for the setting of several internal clocks and timers) system calls
have been executed and always write an audit record to the /var/log/audit.log file upon
exit, tagging the records with the identifier "time-change"
Rationale:
Unexpected changes in system date and/or time could be a sign of malicious activity on the
system.

4.1.6 Ensure events that modify the system's network environment are
collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Record changes to network environment files or system calls. The below parameters
monitor the sethostname (set the systems host name) or setdomainname (set the systems
domainname) system calls, and write an audit event on system call exit. The other
parameters monitor the /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net files (messages displayed prelogin), /etc/hosts (file containing host names and associated IP addresses) and
/etc/network (directory containing network interface scripts and configurations) files.
Rationale:
Monitoring sethostname and setdomainname will identify potential unauthorized changes
to host and domainname of a system. The changing of these names could potentially break
security parameters that are set based on those names. The /etc/hosts file is monitored
for changes in the file that can indicate an unauthorized intruder is trying to change
machine associations with IP addresses and trick users and processes into connecting to
unintended machines. Monitoring /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net is important, as
intruders could put disinformation into those files and trick users into providing
information to the intruder. Monitoring /etc/network is important as it can show if
network interfaces or scripts are being modified in a way that can lead to the machine
becoming unavailable or compromised. All audit records will be tagged with the identifier
"system-locale."

4.1.7 Ensure events that modify the system's Mandatory Access
Controls are collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor SELinux/AppArmor mandatory access controls. The parameters below monitor
any write access (potential additional, deletion or modification of files in the directory) or
attribute changes to the /etc/selinux or /etc/apparmor and /etc/apparmor.d directories.
Rationale:
Changes to files in these directories could indicate that an unauthorized user is attempting
to modify access controls and change security contexts, leading to a compromise of the
system.

4.1.9 Ensure session initiation information is collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor session initiation events. The parameters in this section track changes to the files
associated with session events. The file /var/run/utmp file tracks all currently logged in
users. All audit records will be tagged with the identifier "session." The /var/log/wtmp file
tracks logins, logouts, shutdown, and reboot events. The file /var/log/btmp keeps track of
failed login attempts and can be read by entering the command /usr/bin/last -f
/var/log/btmp . All audit records will be tagged with the identifier "logins."
Rationale:
Monitoring these files for changes could alert a system administrator to logins occurring at
unusual hours, which could indicate intruder activity (i.e. a user logging in at a time when
they do not normally log in).
Audit:
Run the following commands:
# grep session /etc/audit/audit.rules
# auditctl -l | grep session

Verify output of both matches:

4.1.10 Ensure discretionary access control permission modification
events are collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor changes to file permissions, attributes, ownership and group. The parameters in
this section track changes for system calls that affect file permissions and attributes. The
chmod , fchmod and fchmodat system calls affect the permissions associated with a file. The
chown , fchown , fchownat and lchown system calls affect owner and group attributes on a
file. The setxattr , lsetxattr , fsetxattr (set extended file attributes) and removexattr ,
lremovexattr , fremovexattr (remove extended file attributes) control extended file
attributes. In all cases, an audit record will only be written for non-system user ids (auid >=
1000) and will ignore Daemon events (auid = 4294967295). All audit records will be
tagged with the identifier "perm_mod."
Rationale:
Monitoring for changes in file attributes could alert a system administrator to activity that
could indicate intruder activity or policy violation.

4.1.12 Ensure use of privileged commands is collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor privileged programs (those that have the setuid and/or setgid bit set on execution)
to determine if unprivileged users are running these commands.
Rationale:
Execution of privileged commands by non-privileged users could be an indication of
someone trying to gain unauthorized access to the system.
Audit:
Run the following command replacing <partition> with a list of partitions where
programs can be executed from on your system:
# find <partition> -xdev \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f | awk
'{print \
"-a always,exit -F path=" $1 " -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 \
-k privileged" }'

Verify all resulting lines are in the /etc/audit/audit.rules file and the output of auditctl
-l.

254 | P a g e

Remediation:
To remediate this issue, the system administrator will have to execute a find command to
locate all the privileged programs and then add an audit line for each one of them. The
audit parameters associated with this are as follows:
-F path=" $1 " - will populate each file name found through the find command and
processed by awk. -F perm=x - will write an audit record if the file is executed. -F
auid>=1000 - will write a record if the user executing the command is not a privileged user.
-F auid!= 4294967295 - will ignore Daemon events
All audit records should be tagged with the identifier "privileged".
Run the following command replacing with a list of partitions where programs can be
executed from on your system:
# find <partition> -xdev \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f | awk
'{print \
"-a always,exit -F path=" $1 " -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 \

4.1.13 Ensure successful file system mounts are collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount ) system call controls the
mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to
create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user
Rationale:
It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While
tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media
may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's
an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the
media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also
have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a
file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair
indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track
successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the
audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track
data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.

4.1.14 Ensure file deletion events by users are collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor the use of system calls associated with the deletion or renaming of files and file
attributes. This configuration statement sets up monitoring for the unlink (remove a file),
unlinkat (remove a file attribute), rename (rename a file) and renameat (rename a file
attribute) system calls and tags them with the identifier "delete".
Rationale:
Monitoring these calls from non-privileged users could provide a system administrator
with evidence that inappropriate removal of files and file attributes associated with
protected files is occurring. While this audit option will look at all events, system
administrators will want to look for specific privileged files that are being deleted or
altered.
Audit:
On a 32 bit system run the following commands:
# grep delete /etc/audit/audit.rules
# auditctl -l | grep delete

Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor scope changes for system administrations. If the system has been properly
configured to force system administrators to log in as themselves first and then use the
sudo command to execute privileged commands, it is possible to monitor changes in scope.
The file /etc/sudoers will be written to when the file or its attributes have changed. The
audit records will be tagged with the identifier "scope."
Rationale:
Changes in the /etc/sudoers file can indicate that an unauthorized change has been made
to scope of system administrator activity.

(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor the sudo log file. If the system has been properly configured to disable the use of
the su command and force all administrators to have to log in first and then use sudo to
execute privileged commands, then all administrator commands will be logged to
/var/log/sudo.log . Any time a command is executed, an audit event will be triggered as
the /var/log/sudo.log file will be opened for write and the executed administration
command will be written to the log.
Rationale:
Changes in /var/log/sudo.log indicate that an administrator has executed a command or
the log file itself has been tampered with. Administrators will want to correlate the events
written to the audit trail with the records written to /var/log/sudo.log to verify if
unauthorized commands have been executed.
Audit:
Run the following commands:
# grep actions /etc/audit/audit.rules
# auditctl -l | grep actions

4.1.17 Ensure kernel module loading and unloading is collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor the loading and unloading of kernel modules. The programs insmod (install a
kernel module), rmmod (remove a kernel module), and modprobe (a more sophisticated
program to load and unload modules, as well as some other features) control loading and
unloading of modules. The init_module (load a module) and delete_module (delete a
module) system calls control loading and unloading of modules. Any execution of the
loading and unloading module programs and system calls will trigger an audit record with
an identifier of "modules".
Rationale:
Monitoring the use of insmod , rmmod and modprobe could provide system administrators
with evidence that an unauthorized user loaded or unloaded a kernel module, possibly
compromising the security of the system. Monitoring of the init_module and
delete_module system calls would reflect an unauthorized user attempting to use a
different program to load and unload modules.

4.2.1.5 Ensure remote rsyslog messages are only accepted on
designated log hosts. (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
By default, rsyslog does not listen for log messages coming in from remote systems. The
ModLoad tells rsyslog to load the imtcp.so module so it can listen over a network via TCP.
The InputTCPServerRun option instructs rsyslogd to listen on the specified TCP port.
Rationale:
The guidance in the section ensures that remote log hosts are configured to only accept
rsyslog data from hosts within the specified domain and that those systems that are not
designed to be log hosts do not accept any remote rsyslog messages. This provides
protection from spoofed log data and ensures that system administrators are reviewing
reasonably complete syslog data in a central location.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify the resulting lines are uncommented on
designated log hosts and commented or removed on all others:
# grep '$ModLoad imtcp' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf

4.2.2.3 Ensure syslog-ng default file permissions configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
syslog-ng will create logfiles that do not already exist on the system. This setting controls
what permissions will be applied to these newly created files.
Rationale:
It is important to ensure that log files exist and have the correct permissions to ensure that
sensitive syslog-ng data is archived and protected.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify the perm option is 0640 or more restrictive:
# grep ^options /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
options { chain_hostnames(off); flush_lines(0); perm(0640); stats_freq(3600);

4.2.2.4 Ensure syslog-ng is configured to send logs to a remote log host
(Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The syslog-ng utility supports the ability to send logs it gathers to a remote log host or to
receive messages from remote hosts, reducing administrative overhead.
Rationale:
Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker
gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is
stored on the local system
Audit:
Review the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file and verify that logs are sent to a central
host (where logfile.example.com is the name of your central log host):
destination logserver { tcp("logfile.example.com" port(514)); };
log { source(src); destination(logserver); };

287 | P a g e

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file and add the following lines (where

4.2.2.5 Ensure remote syslog-ng messages are only accepted on
designated log hosts (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
By default, syslog-ng does not listen for log messages coming in from remote systems.
Rationale:
The guidance in the section ensures that remote log hosts are configured to only accept
syslog-ng data from hosts within the specified domain and that those systems that are not
designed to be log hosts do not accept any remote syslog-ng messages. This provides
protection from spoofed log data and ensures that system administrators are reviewing
reasonably complete syslog data in a central location.
Audit:
Review the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file and verify the following lines are configured
appropriately on designated log hosts:
source net{ tcp(); };
destination remote { file("/var/log/remote/${FULLHOST}-log"); };
log { source(net); destination(remote); };

289 | P a g e

Remediation:
On designated log hosts edit the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file and configure the
following lines are appropriately:
source net{ tcp(); };
destination remote { file("/var/log/remote/${FULLHOST}-log"); };
log { source(net); destination(remote); };

On non designated log hosts edit the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file and remove or
edit any sources that accept network sourced log messages.

4.2.3 Ensure rsyslog or syslog-ng is installed (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The rsyslog and syslog-ng software are recommended replacements to the original
syslogd daemon which provide improvements over syslogd, such as connection-oriented
(i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of
log data en route to a central logging server.
Rationale:
The security enhancements of rsyslog and syslog-ng such as connection-oriented (i.e.
TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log
data en route to a central logging server) justify installing and configuring the package.
Audit:
Verify either rsyslog or syslog-ng is installed. Depending on the package management in
use one of the following command groups may provide the needed information:
# dpkg -s rsyslog
# dpkg -s syslog-ng

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Log files stored in /var/log/ contain logged information from many services on the system,
or on log hosts others as well.
Rationale:
It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive
data is archived and protected.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that other has no permissions on any files and
group does not have write or execute permissions on any files:
# find /var/log -type f -ls

293 | P a g e

Remediation:
Run the following command to set permissions on all existing log files:
# chmod -R g-wx,o-rwx /var/log/*

Notes:
You may also need to change the configuration for your logging software or services for any
logs that had incorrect permissions.
Some software or environments may re-set the permissions on these files. Site policy

4.3 Ensure logrotate is configured (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The system includes the capability of rotating log files regularly to avoid filling up the
system with logs or making the logs unmanageable large.
Rationale:
By keeping the log files smaller and more manageable, a system administrator can easily
archive these files to another system and spend less time looking through inordinately
large log files.
Audit:
Review /etc/logrotate.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/* and verify logs are rotated
according to site policy.
Remediation:
Edit /etc/logrotate.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/* to ensure logs are rotated according
to site policy.
Notes:
If no maxage setting is set for logrotate a situation can occur where logrotate is interrupted
and fails to delete rotated logfiles. It is recommended to set this to a value greater than the
longest any log file should exist on your system to ensure that any such logfile is removed
but standard rotation settings are not overridden.

Description:
The /etc/crontab file is used by cron to control its own jobs. The commands in this item
make sure that root is the user and group owner of the file and that only the owner can

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Configure /etc/cron.allow and /etc/at.allow to allow specific users to use these
services. If /etc/cron.allow or /etc/at.allow do not exist, then /etc/at.deny and
/etc/cron.deny are checked. Any user not specifically defined in those files is allowed to
use at and cron. By removing the files, only users in /etc/cron.allow and /etc/at.allow
are allowed to use at and cron. Note that even though a given user is not listed in
cron.allow, cron jobs can still be run as that user. The cron.allow file only controls
administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs.
Rationale:
On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule cron jobs. Using
the cron.allow file to control who can run cron jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to
manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to
the system and forget to add it to the deny files.
Audit:
Run the following commands and ensure /etc/cron.deny and /etc/at.deny do not exist:
# stat /etc/cron.deny

5.2.4 Ensure SSH Protocol is set to 2 (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Older versions of SSH support two different and incompatible protocols: SSH1 and SSH2.
SSH1 was the original protocol and was subject to security issues. SSH2 is more advanced
and secure.
Rationale:
SSH v1 suffers from insecurities that do not affect SSH v2.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# grep ^Protocol /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Protocol 2

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:
Protocol 2

Notes:
This command not longer exists in newer versions of SSH. This check is still being included
for systems that may be running an older version of SSH. As of openSSH version 7.4 this

5.2.5 Ensure SSH LogLevel is appropriate (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
INFO level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations,

such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active
on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps
narrow the field.
VERBOSE level specifies that login and logout activity as well as the key fingerprint for any

SSH key used for login will be logged. This information is important for SSH key
management, especially in legacy environments.
Rationale:
SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. DEBUG is specifically
not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides
so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep loglevel

5.2.6 Ensure SSH X11 forwarding is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Workstation
 Level 2 - Server
Description:
The X11Forwarding parameter provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic through the
connection to enable remote graphic connections.
Rationale:
Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11 applications
directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are logged in via
SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by other users on the X11 server. Note
that even if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their own forwarders.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep x11forwarding

5.2.7 Ensure SSH MaxAuthTries is set to 4 or less (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server

Description:
The MaxAuthTries parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts
permitted per connection. When the login failure count reaches half the number, error
messages will be written to the syslog file detailing the login failure.
Rationale:
Setting the MaxAuthTries parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful
brute force attacks to the SSH server. While the recommended setting is 4, set the number
based on site policy.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output MaxAuthTries is 4 or less:
# sshd -T | grep maxauthtries

RhostsRSAAuthentication or HostbasedAuthentication.
Rationale:
Setting this parameter forces users to enter a password when authenticating with ssh.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:

5.2.9 Ensure SSH HostbasedAuthentication is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The HostbasedAuthentication parameter specifies if authentication is allowed through
trusted hosts via the user of .rhosts, or /etc/hosts.equiv, along with successful public
key client host authentication. This option only applies to SSH Protocol Version 2.
Rationale:
Even though the .rhosts files are ineffective if support is disabled in /etc/pam.conf,
disabling the ability to use .rhosts files in SSH provides an additional layer of protection.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep hostbasedauthentication

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The PermitRootLogin parameter specifies if the root user can log in using ssh. The default
is no.
Rationale:
Disallowing root logins over SSH requires system admins to authenticate using their own
individual account, then escalating to root via sudo or su. This in turn limits opportunity for
non-repudiation and provides a clear audit trail in the event of a security incident
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep permitrootlogin

Rationale:
Disallowing remote shell access to accounts that have an empty password reduces the
probability of unauthorized access to the system
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep permitemptypasswords

5.2.13 Ensure only strong ciphers are used (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
This variable limits the ciphers that SSH can use during communication.
Rationale:
Weak ciphers that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module cannot be relied
upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and system data may be compromised
The DES, Triple DES, and Blowfish ciphers, as used in SSH, have a birthday bound of
approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain
cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, aka a
"Sweet32" attack
The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not properly
combine state data with key data during the initialization phase, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks against the initial bytes of a stream
by sniffing network traffic that occasionally relies on keys affected by the Invariance
Weakness, and then using a brute-force approach involving LSB values, aka the "Bar
Mitzvah" issue
The passwords used during an SSH session encrypted with RC4 can be recovered by an
attacker who is able to capture and replay the session
Error handling in the SSH protocol; Client and Server, when using a block cipher algorithm
in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover
certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in an SSH session via unknown
vectors
The mm_newkeys_from_blob function in monitor_wrap.c, when an AES-GCM cipher is used,
does not properly initialize memory for a MAC context data structure, which allows remote
authenticated users to bypass intended ForceCommand and login-shell restrictions via
packet data that provides a crafted callback address

5.2.15 Ensure only strong Key Exchange algorithms are used (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged
between two parties, allowing use of a cryptographic algorithm. If the sender and receiver
wish to exchange encrypted messages, each must be equipped to encrypt messages to be
sent and decrypt messages received
Rationale:
Key exchange methods that are considered weak should be removed. A key exchange
method may be weak because too few bits are used, or the hashing algorithm is considered
too weak. Using weak algorithms could expose connections to man-in-the-middle attacks

5.2.16 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of
ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no
activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax
variable is set, sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval.
When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the
client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15
seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated
after 45 seconds of idle time.
Rationale:
Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user
access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't
lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening..
While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on
site policy. The recommended setting for ClientAliveCountMax is 0. In this case, the client
session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be
sent.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify ClientAliveInterval is between 1 and 300 and
ClientAliveCountMax is 3 or less:
# sshd -T | grep clientaliveinterval
ClientAliveInterval 300
# sshd -T | grep clientalivecountmax

5.2.17 Ensure SSH LoginGraceTime is set to one minute or less (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The LoginGraceTime parameter specifies the time allowed for successful authentication to
the SSH server. The longer the Grace period is the more open unauthenticated connections
can exist. Like other session controls in this session the Grace Period should be limited to
appropriate organizational limits to ensure the service is available for needed access.
Rationale:
Setting the LoginGraceTime parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful
brute force attacks to the SSH server. It will also limit the number of concurrent
unauthenticated connections While the recommended setting is 60 seconds (1 Minute), set
the number based on site policy.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system
via SSH. It is recommended that at least one of the following options be leveraged:
AllowUsers

The AllowUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific
users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated user names. Numeric user
IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user
access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host, the entry
can be specified in the form of user@host.
AllowGroups

The AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific
groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated group names.
Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.
DenyUsers

The DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific users
to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated user names. Numeric user IDs
are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user
access further by specifically denying a user's access from a particular host, the entry can

DenyGroups

The DenyGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific
groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated group names.

5.2.19 Ensure SSH warning banner is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The Banner parameter specifies a file whose contents must be sent to the remote user
before authentication is permitted. By default, no banner is displayed.
Rationale:
Banners are used to warn connecting users of the particular site's policy regarding
connection. Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist the
prosecution of trespassers on the computer system.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep banner

5.3 Configure PAM
PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a service that implements modular
authentication modules on UNIX systems. PAM is implemented as a set of shared objects
that are loaded and executed when a program needs to authenticate a user. Files for PAM
are typically located in the /etc/pam.d directory. PAM must be carefully configured to
secure system authentication. While this section covers some of PAM, please consult other
PAM resources to fully understand the configuration capabilities.

5.3.1 Ensure password creation requirements are configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The pam_pwquality.so module checks the strength of passwords. It performs checks such
as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of
characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more. The following are definitions of the
pam_pwquality.so options.


retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure.

The following options are set in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file:






minlen = 14 - password must be 14 characters or more
dcredit = -1 - provide at least one digit
ucredit = -1 - provide at least one uppercase character
ocredit = -1 - provide at least one special character
lcredit = -1 - provide at least one lowercase character

The settings shown above are one possible policy. Alter these values to conform to your
own organization's password policies.
Rationale:
Strong passwords protect systems from being hacked through brute force methods.

341 | P a g e

Audit:
Run the following commands and verify all password requirements conform to
organization policy and minlen is 14 or more:
# grep pam_pwquality.so /etc/pam.d/common-password
password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3
# grep ^minlen /etc/security/pwquality.conf
minlen = 14
# grep ^dcredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf

5.3.2 Ensure lockout for failed password attempts is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Lock out users after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts. The first sets of changes are
made to the PAM configuration files. The second set of changes are applied to the program
specific PAM configuration file. The second set of changes must be applied to each program
that will lock out users. Check the documentation for each secondary program for
instructions on how to configure them to work with PAM.
Set the lockout number to the policy in effect at your site.
Rationale:
Locking out user IDs after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts mitigates brute force
password attacks against your systems.
Audit:
Perform the following to determine the current settings for user lockout.
# grep "pam_tally2" /etc/pam.d/common-auth
auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900

344 | P a g e

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/pam.d/common-auth file and add the auth line below:
auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900

Note: If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive
failure count defined by deny= in the pam_tally2.so module, the user can be unlocked by
issuing the command /sbin/pam_tally2 -u <username> --reset. This command sets the
failed count to 0, effectively unlocking the user.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The commands below change password encryption from md5 to sha512 (a much stronger
hashing algorithm). All existing accounts will need to perform a password change to
upgrade the stored hashes to the new algorithm.
Rationale:
The SHA-512 algorithm provides much stronger hashing than MD5, thus providing
additional protection to the system by increasing the level of effort for an attacker to
successfully determine passwords.
Note that these change only apply to accounts configured on the local system.
Audit:
Run the following commands and ensure the sha512 option is included in all results:
# egrep '^password\s+(\S+\s+)+pam_unix\.so\s+(\S+\s+)*sha512'
/etc/pam.d/common-password

Notes:
Additional module options may be set, recommendation only covers those listed here.
If it is determined that the password algorithm being used is not SHA-512, once it is
changed, it is recommended that all user ID's be immediately expired and forced to change
their passwords on next login. To accomplish that, the following commands can be used.
Any system accounts that need to be expired should be carefully done separately by the
system administrator to prevent any potential problems.

5.4.1.1 Ensure password expiration is 365 days or less (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to force
passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. It is recommended that the
PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter be set to less than or equal to 365 days.
Rationale:
The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or
successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of
the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an
attacker's window of opportunity.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify PASS_MAX_DAYS conforms to site policy (no more
than 365 days):
# grep PASS_MAX_DAYS /etc/login.defs
PASS_MAX_DAYS 90

Verify all users with a password maximum days between password change conforms to site

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The PASS_MIN_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to prevent
users from changing their password until a minimum number of days have passed since the
last time the user changed their password. It is recommended that PASS_MIN_DAYS
parameter be set to 7 or more days.
Rationale:
By restricting the frequency of password changes, an administrator can prevent users from
repeatedly changing their password in an attempt to circumvent password reuse controls.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify PASS_MIN_DAYS is 7 or more:
# grep PASS_MIN_DAYS /etc/login.defs

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server

Description:
The PASS_WARN_AGE parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to notify users
that their password will expire in a defined number of days. It is recommended that the
PASS_WARN_AGE parameter be set to 7 or more days.
Rationale:
Providing an advance warning that a password will be expiring gives users time to think of
a secure password. Users caught unaware may choose a simple password or write it down
where it may be discovered.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify PASS_WARN_AGE is 7 or more:
# grep PASS_WARN_AGE /etc/login.defs

Description:
User accounts that have been inactive for over a given period of time can be automatically
disabled. It is recommended that accounts that are inactive for 30 days after password
expiration be disabled.
Rationale:
Inactive accounts pose a threat to system security since the users are not logging in to
notice failed login attempts or other anomalies.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify INACTIVE is 30 or less:
# useradd -D | grep INACTIVE

5.4.2 Ensure system accounts are non-login (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
There are a number of accounts provided with Debian that are used to manage applications
and are not intended to provide an interactive shell.
Rationale:
It is important to make sure that accounts that are not being used by regular users are
prevented from being used to provide an interactive shell. By default, Debian sets the
password field for these accounts to an invalid string, but it is also recommended that the
shell field in the password file be set to /usr/sbin/nologin. Some built-in accounts use
/bin/false which is also acceptable. This prevents the account from potentially being used
to run any commands.
Audit:
Run the following scripts and verify no results are returned:
egrep -v "^\+" /etc/passwd | awk -F: '($1!="root" && $1!="sync" &&
$1!="shutdown" && $1!="halt" && $3<1000 && $7!="/usr/sbin/nologin" &&
$7!="/bin/false") {print}'

5.4.4 Ensure default user umask is 027 or more restrictive (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The default umask determines the permissions of files created by users. The user creating
the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the
chmod command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by
others by default may choose a different default umask by inserting the umask command
into the standard shell configuration files ( .profile , .bashrc , etc.) in their home
directories.
Rationale:
Setting a very secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice
about their file permissions. A default umask setting of 077 causes files and directories
created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system. A umask of 027 would
make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a umask of 022
would make files readable by every user on the system.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify all umask lines returned are 027 or more
restrictive.
# grep "umask" /etc/bash.bashrc
umask 027
# grep "umask" /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/*.sh
umask 027

Notes:
The audit and remediation in this recommendation apply to bash and shell. If other shells
are supported on the system, it is recommended that their configuration files also are
checked.
Other methods of setting a default user umask exist however the shell configuration files
are the last run and will override other settings if they exist therefor our recommendation
is to configure in the shell configuration files. If other methods are in use in your
environment they should be audited and the shell configs should be verified to not
override.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The default TMOUT determines the shell timeout for users. The TMOUT value is measured in
seconds.
Rationale:
Having no timeout value associated with a shell could allow an unauthorized user access to
another user's shell session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the
screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify all TMOUT lines returned are 900 or less and at
least one exists in each file.
# grep "^TMOUT" /etc/bash.bashrc

5.6 Ensure access to the su command is restricted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program
has been superseded by sudo, which allows for more granular control over privileged
access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the
pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su, the su command will only allow users in the
sudo group to execute su.
Rationale:
Restricting the use of su, and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better
control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility
also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed
via sudo, whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output includes matching line:
# grep pam_wheel.so /etc/pam.d/su
auth required pam_wheel.so

Run the following command and verify users in sudo group match site policy:
# grep sudo /etc/group

6.1.1 Audit system file permissions (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The Debian package manager has a number of useful options. One of these, the --verify
option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The --verify
option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no
output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the
meaning of output from the verify option:
Code

Meaning

S

File size differs.

M

File mode differs (includes permissions and file type).

5

The MD5 checksum differs.

D

The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file.

L

A mismatch occurs in a link.

U

The file ownership differs.

G

The file group owner differs.

T

The file time (mtime) differs.

The dpkg -S command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to.
For example the following commands determines which package the /bin/bash file
belongs to:
# dpkg -S /bin/bash
bash: /bin/bash

To verify the settings for the package that controls the /bin/bash file, run the following:
# dpkg --verify bash
??5?????? c /etc/bash.bashrc

372 | P a g e

Rationale:
It is important to confirm that packaged system files and directories are maintained with
the permissions they were intended to have from the OS vendor.
Audit:
Run the following command to review all installed packages. Note that this may be very
time consuming and may be best scheduled via the cron utility. It is recommended that the
output of this command be redirected to a file that can be reviewed later.
# dpkg --verify > <filename>

Remediation:
Correct any discrepancies found and rerun the audit until output is clean or risk is
mitigated or accepted.
Notes:
Since packages and important files may change with new updates and releases, it is
recommended to verify everything, not just a finite list of files. This can be a time
consuming task and results may depend on site policy therefore it is not a scorable
benchmark item, but is provided for those interested in additional security measures.
Some of the recommendations of this benchmark alter the state of files audited by this
recommendation. The audit command will alert for all changes to a file permissions even if
the new state is more secure than the default.

6.1.2 Ensure permissions on /etc/passwd are configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The /etc/passwd file contains user account information that is used by many system
utilities and therefore must be readable for these utilities to operate.
Rationale:
It is critical to ensure that the /etc/passwd file is protected from unauthorized write
access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions could be changed either
inadvertently or through malicious actions.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The /etc/shadow file is used to store the information about user accounts that is critical to
the security of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security
information.
Rationale:
If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a password
cracking program against the hashed password to break it. Other security information that
is stored in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert the
user accounts.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Unix-based systems support variable settings to control access to files. World writable files
are the least secure. See the chmod(2) man page for more information.
Rationale:
Data in world-writable files can be modified and compromised by any user on the system.
World writable files may also indicate an incorrectly written script or program that could
potentially be the cause of a larger compromise to the system's integrity.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify no files are returned:
# df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev
-type f -perm -0002

The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items
on network mounted partitions. Additionally the --local option to df is not universal to all
versions, it can be omitted to search all filesystems on a system including network mounted
filesystems or the following command can be run manually for each partition:
# find <partition> -xdev -type f -perm -0002

Remediation:
Removing write access for the "other" category (chmod o-w <filename>) is advisable, but
always consult relevant vendor documentation to avoid breaking any application

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's
permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the
group. The most common reason for a SUID program is to enable users to perform
functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges.
Rationale:
There are valid reasons for SUID programs, but it is important to identify and review such
programs to ensure they are legitimate.
Audit:
Run the following command to list SUID files:
# df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev

Rationale:
All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by
an unauthorized user.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that no output is returned:
# cat /etc/shadow | awk -F: '($2 == "" ) { print $1 " does not have a

Remediation:
If any accounts in the /etc/shadow file do not have a password, run the following command
to lock the account until it can be determined why it does not have a password:
# passwd -l <username>

Making global modifications to users' files without alerting the user community can result
in unexpected outages and unhappy users. Therefore, it is recommended that a monitoring
policy be established to report user dot file permissions and determine the action to be
taken in accordance with site policy.

6.2.11 Ensure no users have .forward files (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The .forward file specifies an email address to forward the user's mail to.
Rationale:
Use of the .forward file poses a security risk in that sensitive data may be inadvertently
transferred outside the organization. The .forward file also poses a risk as it can be used to
execute commands that may perform unintended actions.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/passwd | egrep -v '^(root|halt|sync|shutdown)' | awk -F: '($7 !=

6.2.12 Ensure no users have .netrc files (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The .netrc file contains data for logging into a remote host for file transfers via FTP.
Rationale:
The .netrc file presents a significant security risk since it stores passwords in unencrypted
form. Even if FTP is disabled, user accounts may have brought over .netrc files from other
systems which could pose a risk to those systems.

6.2.14 Ensure no users have .rhosts files (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
While no .rhosts files are shipped by default, users can easily create them.
Rationale:
This action is only meaningful if .rhosts support is permitted in the file /etc/pam.conf.
Even though the .rhosts files are ineffective if support is disabled in /etc/pam.conf, they
may have been brought over from other systems and could contain information useful to
an attacker for those other systems.

6.2.15 Ensure all groups in /etc/passwd exist in /etc/group (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Over time, system administration errors and changes can lead to groups being defined in
/etc/passwd but not in /etc/group.
Rationale:
Groups defined in the /etc/passwd file but not in the /etc/group file pose a threat to
system security since group permissions are not properly managed.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
#!/bin/bash
for i in $(cut -s -d: -f4 /etc/passwd | sort -u ); do
grep -q -P "^.*?:[^:]*:$i:" /etc/group

 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Although the useradd program will not let you create a duplicate User ID (UID), it is
possible for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/passwd file and change the UID
field.
Rationale:
Users must be assigned unique UIDs for accountability and to ensure appropriate access
protections.

6.2.18 Ensure no duplicate user names exist (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Although the useradd program will not let you create a duplicate user name, it is possible
for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/passwd file and change the user name.
Rationale:
If a user is assigned a duplicate user name, it will create and have access to files with the
first UID for that username in /etc/passwd. For example, if "test4" has a UID of 1000 and a
subsequent "test4" entry has a UID of 2000, logging in as "test4" will use UID 1000.
Effectively, the UID is shared, which is a security problem.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/passwd | cut -f1 -d":" | sort -n | uniq -c | while read x ; do
[ -z "${x}" ] && break
set - $x
if [ $1 -gt 1 ]; then
uids=`awk -F: '($1 == n) { print $3 }' n=$2 /etc/passwd | xargs`
echo "Duplicate User Name ($2): ${uids}"
fi
done

Remediation:
Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique user names for the users. File
ownerships will automatically reflect the change as long as the users have unique UIDs.

Description:
Although the groupadd program will not let you create a duplicate group name, it is
possible for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/group file and change the group
name.
Rationale:
If a group is assigned a duplicate group name, it will create and have access to files with the
first GID for that group in /etc/group. Effectively, the GID is shared, which is a security
problem.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:

6.2.20 Ensure shadow group is empty (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability to read the
/etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group.
Rationale:
Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow
file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a password
cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security information
that is stored in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert
additional user accounts.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify no results are returned:
# grep ^shadow:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]+ /etc/group
# awk -F: '($4 == "<shadow-gid>") { print }' /etc/passwd

Remediation:
Remove all users from the shadow group, and change the primary group of any users with
shadow as their primary group.
