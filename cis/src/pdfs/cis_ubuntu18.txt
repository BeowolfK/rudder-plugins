Overview
This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration
posture for Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS systems running on x86 and x64 platforms.
Many lists are included including filesystem types, services, clients, and network protocols.
Not all items in these lists are guaranteed to exist on all distributions and additional similar
items may exist which should be considered in addition to those explicitly mentioned.
The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the root user.
Operations performed using sudo instead of the root user may produce unexpected results,
or fail to make the intended changes to the system. Non-root users may not be able to
access certain areas of the system, especially after remediation has been performed. It is
advisable to verify root users path integrity and the integrity of any programs being run
prior to execution of commands and scripts included in this benchmark.
The guidance in this document includes changes to the running system configuration.
Failure to test system configuration changes in a test environment prior to implementation
on a production system could lead to loss of services.
To obtain the latest version of this guide, please visit http://workbench.cisecurity.org. If
you have questions, comments, or have identified ways to improve this guide, please write
us at feedback@cisecurity.org.

Intended Audience
This benchmark is intended for system and application administrators, security specialists,
auditors, help desk, and platform deployment personnel who plan to develop, deploy,
assess, or secure solutions that incorporate Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS on a x86 or x64
platform.

Consensus Guidance
This benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of subject
matter experts. Consensus participants provide perspective from a diverse set of
backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and compliance, security
research, operations, government, and legal.
Each CIS benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase occurs
during initial benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts convene
to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the benchmark. This discussion occurs until
13 | P a g e

consensus has been reached on benchmark recommendations. The second phase begins
after the benchmark has been published. During this phase, all feedback provided by the
Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for incorporation in the
benchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus process, please visit
https://workbench.cisecurity.org/.

Recommendations

19 | P a g e

1 Initial Setup
Items in this section are advised for all systems, but may be difficult or require extensive
preparation after the initial setup of the system.

20 | P a g e

1.1 Filesystem Configuration
Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing
them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables
the use of mounting options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. Users' data
can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a
filesystem that has been established for use by the users and does not contain software for
system operations.
The recommendations in this section are easier to perform during initial system
installation. If the system is already installed, it is recommended that a full backup be
performed before repartitioning the system.
Note: If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data
has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data from the
directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old
partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system
is in single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data
to the /tmp directory, this data will still consume space in / once the /tmp filesystem is
mounted unless it is removed first.

21 | P a g e

1.1.1 Disable unused filesystems
A number of uncommon filesystem types are supported under Linux. Removing support for
unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If a filesystem
type is not needed it should be disabled. Native Linux file systems are designed to ensure
that built-in security controls function as expected. Non-native filesystems can lead to
unexpected consequences to both the security and functionality of the system and should
be used with caution. Many filesystems are created for niche use cases and are not
maintained and supported as the operating systems are updated and patched. Users of
non-native filesystems should ensure that there is attention and ongoing support for them,
especially in light of frequent operating system changes.
Standard network connectivity and Internet access to cloud storage may make the use of
non-standard filesystem formats to directly attach heterogeneous devices much less
attractive.
Note: This should not be considered a comprehensive list of filesystems. You may wish to
consider additions to those listed here for your environment.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The udf filesystem type is the universal disk format used to implement ISO/IEC 13346 and
ECMA-167 specifications. This is an open vendor filesystem type for data storage on a
broad range of media. This filesystem type is necessary to support writing DVDs and newer
optical disc formats.
Rationale:
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the
system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.
Audit:

1.1.1.8 Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is limited (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Workstation
 Level 2 - Server
Description:
The FAT filesystem format is primarily used on older windows systems and portable USB
drives or flash modules. It comes in three types FAT12 , FAT16 , and FAT32 all of which are
supported by the vfat kernel module.
Rationale:
Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the
system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.
Audit:
If utilizing UEFI the FAT filesystem format is required. If this case, ensure that the FAT
filesystem is only used where appropriate
Run the following command
grep -E -i '\svfat\s' /etc/fstab

And review that any output is appropriate for your environment
If not utilizing UEFI
Run the following commands and verify the output is as indicated:
# modprobe --showconfig | grep vfat
install vfat /bin/true
# lsmod | grep vfat
<No output>

37 | P a g e

Remediation:
Edit or create a file in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory ending in .conf
Example: vi /etc/modprobe.d/vfat.conf
install vfat /bin/true

Run the following command to unload the vfat module:
# rmmod vfat

Impact:
The FAT filesystem format is used by UEFI systems for the EFI boot partition. Disabling the
vfat module can prevent boot on UEFI systems.
FAT filesystems are often used on portable USB sticks and other flash media which are

commonly used to transfer files between workstations, removing VFAT support may
prevent the ability to transfer files in this way.

operating systems and software.

38 | P a g e

1.1.2 Ensure /tmp is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users
and some applications.
Rationale:
Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the
mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also
prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it
to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the
attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a
security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.
This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate
partition for /tmp.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output shows /tmp is mounted:
# mount | grep -E '\s/tmp\s'
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)

Run the following command and verify that tmpfs has been mounted to, or a system
partition has been created for /tmp
#

grep -E '\s/tmp\s' /etc/fstab | grep -E -v '^\s*#'

Remediation:
Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.
Example:
tmpfs

/tmp

tmpfs

defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime

0 0

OR
Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting:
systemctl unmask tmp.mount
systemctl enable tmp.mount

Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp
mount:
[Mount]
What=tmpfs
Where=/tmp
Type=tmpfs
Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid

Impact:
Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource
exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.
Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it,
but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available,
as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs
will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the
filesystem much more easily.
/tmp utalizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter on the Options line on
the tmp.mount file

1.1.3 Ensure nodev option set on /tmp partition (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The nodev mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices.
Rationale:
Since the /tmp filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that
users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices in /tmp .
Audit:
Verify that the nodev option is set if a /tmp partition exists
Run the following command and verify that nothing is returned:
# mount | grep -E '\s/tmp\s' | grep -v nodev

42 | P a g e

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options) for the /tmp
partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.
Run the following command to remount /tmp :
# mount -o remount,nodev /tmp

OR If systemd tmp.mount is configured:

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The nosuid mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain setuid files.
Rationale:
Since the /tmp filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to
ensure that users cannot create setuid files in /tmp .
Audit:
Verify that the nosuid option is set if a /tmp partition exists
Run the following command and verify that nothing is returned:
# mount | grep -E '\s/tmp\s' | grep -v nosuid

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The noexec mount option specifies that the filesystem cannot contain executable binaries.
Rationale:
Since the /tmp filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to
ensure that users cannot run executable binaries from /tmp .

1.1.6 Ensure separate partition exists for /var (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store
dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable.
Rationale:
Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of
resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output shows /var is mounted:
# mount | grep -E '\s/var\s'
/dev/xvdg1 on /var type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)

48 | P a g e

Remediation:
For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a
separate partition for /var .
For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure
/etc/fstab as appropriate.
Impact:
Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem
partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional
tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may
introduce their own security considerations.
References:
1. AJ Lewis, "LVM HOWTO", http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/
Notes:
When modifying /var it is advisable to bring the system to emergency mode (so auditd is
not running), rename the existing directory, mount the new file system, and migrate the
data over before returning to multiuser mode.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The /var/log directory is used by system services to store log data .
Rationale:
There are two important reasons to ensure that system logs are stored on a separate
partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since logs can grow quite large) and
protection of audit data.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output shows /var/log is mounted:
# mount | grep /var/log

Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The auditing daemon, auditd , stores log data in the /var/log/audit directory.
Rationale:
There are two important reasons to ensure that data gathered by auditd is stored on a
separate partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since the audit.log file can
grow quite large) and protection of audit data. The audit daemon calculates how much free
space is left and performs actions based on the results. If other processes (such as syslog )
consume space in the same partition as auditd , it may not perform as desired.

1.1.22 Disable Automounting (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
autofs allows automatic mounting of devices, typically including CD/DVDs and USB drives.

Rationale:
With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a USB drive or disc
and have its contents available in system even if they lacked permissions to mount it
themselves.
Audit:
autofs should be removed or disabled.
Run the following commands to verify that autofs is not installed or is disabled
Run the following command to verify autofs is not enabled:
# systemctl is-enabled autofs
disabled

Verify result is not "enabled".
OR
Run the following command to verfiy that autofs is not installed
# dpkg -s autofs

Output should include:
package `autofs` is not installed

73 | P a g e

Remediation:
Run one of the following commands:
Run the following command to disable autofs :
# systemctl --now disable autofs

OR
Run the following command to remove autofs
# apt purge autofs

Impact:
The use of portable hard drives is very common for workstation users. If your organization
allows the use of portable storage or media on workstations and physical access controls to
workstations is considered adequate there is little value add in turning off automounting.
Notes:
Additional methods of disabling a service exist. Consult your distribution documentation
for appropriate methods.
This control should align with the tolerance of the use of portable drives and optical media
in the organization. On a server requiring an admin to manually mount media can be part
of defense-in-depth to reduce the risk of unapproved software or information being
introduced or proprietary software or information being exfiltrated. If admins commonly
use flash drives and Server access has sufficient physical controls, requiring manual
mounting may not increase security.

Description:
USB storage provides a means to transfer and store files insuring persistence and
availability of the files independent of network connection status. Its popularity and utility
has led to USB-based malware being a simple and common means for network infiltration
and a first step to establishing a persistent threat within a networked environment.
Rationale:
Restricting USB access on the system will decrease the physical attack surface for a device
and diminish the possible vectors to introduce malware.

Ubuntu Linux use apt to install and update software packages. Patch management
procedures may vary widely between enterprises. Large enterprises may choose to install a
local updates server that can be used in place of their distributions servers, whereas a
single deployment of a system may prefer to get updates directly. Updates can be
performed automatically or manually, depending on the site's policy for patch
management. Many large enterprises prefer to test patches on a non-production system
before rolling out to production.

1.5 Secure Boot Settings
The recommendations in this section focus on securing the bootloader and settings
involved in the boot process directly.

90 | P a g e

1.5.1 Ensure permissions on bootloader config are configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The grub configuration file contains information on boot settings and passwords for
unlocking boot options. The grub configuration is usually grub.cfg stored in /boot/grub/.
Rationale:
Setting the permissions to read and write for root only prevents non-root users from
seeing the boot parameters or changing them. Non-root users who read the boot
parameters may be able to identify weaknesses in security upon boot and be able to exploit
them.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access does not
grant permissions to group or other :
# stat /boot/grub/grub.cfg
Access: (0400/-r--------)

Uid: (

0/

root)

Gid: (

0/

Remediation:
Run the following commands to set permissions on your grub configuration:
# chown root:root /boot/grub/grub.cfg
# chmod og-rwx /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Notes:
This recommendation is designed around the grub bootloader, if LILO or another
bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings.

1.5.2 Ensure bootloader password is set (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter
a password before being able to set command line boot parameters
Rationale:
Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized
user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users
from weakening security (e.g. turning off AppArmor at boot time).
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# grep "^set superusers" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
set superusers="<username>"
# grep "^password" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>

93 | P a g e

Remediation:
Create an encrypted password with grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2:
# grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
Enter password: <password>
Reenter password: <password>
Your PBKDF2 is <encrypted-password>

Add the following into a custom /etc/grub.d configuration file:
cat <<EOF
set superusers="<username>"
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>
EOF

The superuser/user information and password should not be contained in the
/etc/grub.d/00_header file as this file could be overwritten in a package update.
If there is a requirement to be able to boot/reboot without entering the password, edit
/etc/grub.d/10_linux and add --unrestricted to the line CLASS=
Example:
CLASS="--class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os --unrestricted"

Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:
# update-grub

Impact:
If password protection is enabled, only the designated superuser can edit a Grub 2 menu
item by pressing "e" or access the GRUB 2 command line by pressing "c"
If GRUB 2 is set up to boot automatically to a password-protected menu entry the user has
no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu entry. Holding the
SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username
and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or
other means to fix the problem
You can add --unrestricted to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without
entering a password. Password will still be required to edit menu items.

Description:
Interactive boot allows console users to interactively select which services start on boot.
Not all distributions support this capability.
The PROMPT_FOR_CONFIRM option provides console users the ability to interactively boot the
system and select which services to start on boot .
Rationale:

potentially overriding established security settings.
Audit:
If interactive boot is available verify it is disabled on your system. On some distributions
this is configured via the PROMPT_FOR_CONFIRM option in /etc/sysconfig/boot :
# grep "^PROMPT_FOR_CONFIRM=" /etc/sysconfig/boot
PROMPT_FOR_CONFIRM="no"

1.6.1 Ensure XD/NX support is enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per
memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute
(NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help
prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever
possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on
32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such
support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature.
Rationale:
Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security
of the system.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify your kernel has identified and activated NX/XD
protection.
# journalctl | grep 'protection: active'
kernel: NX (Execute Disable) protection: active

OR
on systems without journalctl
# [[ -n $(grep noexec[0-9]*=off /proc/cmdline) || -z $(grep -E -i ' (pae|nx)
' /proc/cpuinfo) || -n $(grep '\sNX\s.*\sprotection:\s' /var/log/dmesg | grep
-v active) ]] && echo "NX Protection is not active"

Nothing should be returned

99 | P a g e

Remediation:
On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit
systems:
If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system.
You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios.
Notes:
Ensure your system supports the XD or NX bit and has PAE support before implementing
this recommendation as this may prevent it from booting if these are not supported by
your hardware.

1.6.4 Ensure core dumps are restricted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine
why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core
file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be
overridden by the user.
Rationale:
Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core
dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5) ). In
addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from
dumping core.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# grep "hard core" /etc/security/limits.conf /etc/security/limits.d/*
* hard core 0
# sysctl fs.suid_dumpable
fs.suid_dumpable = 0
# grep "fs\.suid_dumpable" /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*
fs.suid_dumpable = 0

1.7 Mandatory Access Control
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) provides an additional layer of access restrictions to
processes on top of the base Discretionary Access Controls. By restricting how processes
can access files and resources on a system the potential impact from vulnerabilities in the
processes can be reduced.
Impact: Mandatory Access Control limits the capabilities of applications and daemons on a
system, while this can prevent unauthorized access the configuration of MAC can be
complex and difficult to implement correctly preventing legitimate access from occurring.
Note: Apparmor is the default MAC provided with Ubuntu systems.
Note: Additional Mandatory Access Control systems to include SELinux exist. If a different
Mandatory Access Control systems is used, please follow it's vendors guidance for proper
implementation in place of the guidance provided in this section

106 | P a g e

1.7.1 Configure AppArmor
AppArmor provides a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system that greatly augments the
default Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model. Under AppArmor MAC rules are applied
by file paths instead of by security contexts as in other MAC systems. As such it does not
require support in the filesystem and can be applied to network mounted filesystems for
example. AppArmor security policies define what system resources applications can access
and what privileges they can do so with. This automatically limits the damage that the
software can do to files accessible by the calling user. The user does not need to take any
action to gain this benefit. For an action to occur, both the traditional DAC permissions
must be satisfied as well as the AppArmor MAC rules. The action will not be allowed if
either one of these models does not permit the action. In this way, AppArmor rules can only
make a system's permissions more restrictive and secure.

1.8 Warning Banners
Presenting a warning message prior to the normal user login may assist in the prosecution
of trespassers on the computer system. Changing some of these login banners also has the
side effect of hiding OS version information and other detailed system information from
attackers attempting to target specific exploits at a system.
Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages
include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system
is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and
that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. It is important that the
organization's legal counsel review the content of all messages before any system
modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific. More
information (including citations of relevant case law) can be found at

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Periodically patches are released for included software either due to security flaws or to
include additional functionality.
Rationale:
Newer patches may contain security enhancements that would not be available through the
latest full update. As a result, it is recommended that the latest software patches be used to
take advantage of the latest functionality. As with any software installation, organizations
need to determine if a given update meets their requirements and verify the compatibility
and supportability of any additional software against the update revision that is selected.
Audit:
Verify there are no updates or patches to install:
# apt -s upgrade

Remediation:
Use your package manager to update all packages on the system according to site policy.
Run the following command to update all packages following local site policy guidance on
applying updates and patches:
# apt upgrade

OR
# apt dist-upgrade

128 | P a g e

Notes:
Site policy may mandate a testing period before install onto production systems for
available updates.
upgrade: upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed
on the system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently
installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances
are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and
installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without
changing the install status of another package will be left at their current version. An
update must be performed first so that apt knows that new versions of packages are
available.
dist-upgrade: dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also
intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; apt has a
"smart" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important
packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. So, dist-upgrade command
may remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from
which to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for
overriding the general settings for individual packages.

2 Services
While applying system updates and patches helps correct known vulnerabilities, one of the
best ways to protect the system against as yet unreported vulnerabilities is to disable all
services that are not required for normal system operation. This prevents the exploitation
of vulnerabilities discovered at a later date. If a service is not enabled, it cannot be
exploited. The actions in this section of the document provide guidance on some services
which can be safely disabled and under which circumstances, greatly reducing the number
of possible threats to the resulting system. Additionally some services which should remain
enabled but with secure configuration are covered as well as insecure service clients.

Description:
The eXtended InterNET Daemon (xinetd) is an open source super daemon that replaced
the original inetd daemon. The xinetd daemon listens for well known services and
dispatches the appropriate daemon to properly respond to service requests.
Rationale:
If there are no xinetd services required, it is recommended that the package be removed.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify xinetd is not installed:
# dpkg -s xinetd

Verify result is:
dpkg-query: package 'xinetd' is not installed and no information is available
Use dpkg --info (= dpkg-deb --info) to examine archive files,
and dpkg --contents (= dpkg-deb --contents) to list their contents.

2.2.1 Time Synchronization
It is recommended that physical systems and virtual guests lacking direct access to the
physical host's clock be configured to synchronize their time using a service such as
systemd-timesyncd, chrony, or ntp.
If access to a physical host's clock is available and configured according to site policy, this
section can be skipped.

136 | P a g e

2.2.1.1 Ensure time synchronization is in use (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
System time should be synchronized between all systems in an environment. This is
typically done by establishing an authoritative time server or set of servers and having all
systems synchronize their clocks to them.
Rationale:
Time synchronization is important to support time sensitive security mechanisms like
Kerberos and also ensures log files have consistent time records across the enterprise,
which aids in forensic investigations.
Audit:
On physical systems or virtual systems where host based time synchronization is not
available verify that timesyncd, chrony, or NTP is installed. Use one of the following
commands to determine the needed information:
If systemd-timesyncd is used:
# systemctl is-enabled systemd-timesyncd

If chrony is used:
# dpkg -s chrony

If ntp is used:
# dpkg -s ntp

On virtual systems where host based time synchronization is available consult your
virtualization software documentation and verify that host based synchronization is in use.

137 | P a g e

Remediation:
On systems where host based time synchronization is not available, configure systemdtimesyncd. If "full featured" and/or encrypted time synchronization is required, install
chrony or NTP.
To install chrony:
# atp install chrony

To install ntp:
# apt install ntp

On virtual systems where host based time synchronization is available consult your
virtualization software documentation and setup host based synchronization.
Notes:
systemd-timesyncd is part of systemd. Some versions of systemd have been compiled
without systemd-timesycnd. On these distributions, chrony or NTP should be used instead
of systemd-timesycnd.

2.2.1.2 Ensure systemd-timesyncd is configured (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
systemd-timesyncd is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock
across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such
as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not
bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote
server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges,
and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is
available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been
acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to
accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded
devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is
not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group "systemdtimesync" needs to be created on installation of systemd.
Note: The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP. This minimalistic
service will set the system clock for large offsets or slowly adjust it for smaller deltas. More
complex use cases are not covered by systemd-timesyncd.
This recommendation only applies if timesyncd is in use on the system.
Rationale:
Proper configuration is vital to ensuring time synchronization is working properly.

139 | P a g e

 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP
commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the
information and then send results back to the requesting system.
Rationale:
The SNMP server can communicate using SNMP v1, which transmits data in the clear and
does not require authentication to execute commands. Unless absolutely necessary, it is
recommended that the SNMP service not be used. If SNMP is required the server should be
configured to disallow SNMP v1.

2.2.15 Ensure mail transfer agent is configured for local-only mode
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to listen for incoming
mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate user or mail server. If the system is not
intended to be a mail server, it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process
local mail.
Rationale:
The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long history of
security issues. While it is important to ensure that the system can process local mail
messages, it is not necessary to have the MTA's daemon listening on a port unless the
server is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems.
Audit:
Run the following command to verify that the MTA is not listening on any non-loopback
address ( 127.0.0.1 or ::1 )
Nothing should be returned
#

ss -lntu | grep -E ':25\s' | grep -E -v '\s(127.0.0.1|::1):25\s'

the line already exists, change it to look like the line below:
inet_interfaces = loopback-only

Restart postfix:
# systemctl restart postfix

Description:
The Network Information Service (NIS) (formally known as Yellow Pages) is a client-server
directory service protocol for distributing system configuration files. The NIS server is a
collection of programs that allow for the distribution of configuration files.
Rationale:
The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable to DOS attacks,
buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying NIS maps. NIS generally has
been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is
recommended that the service be disabled and other, more secure services be used

177 | P a g e

2.3.1 Ensure NIS Client is not installed (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages, is a client-server
directory service protocol used to distribute system configuration files. The NIS client was
used to bind a machine to an NIS server and receive the distributed configuration files.
Rationale:
The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable to DOS attacks,
buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying NIS maps. NIS generally has
been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is

 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The rsh package contains the client commands for the rsh services.
Rationale:
These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have been replaced with the
more secure SSH package. Even if the server is removed, it is best to ensure the clients are
also removed to prevent users from inadvertently attempting to use these commands and
therefore exposing their credentials. Note that removing the rsh package removes the
clients for rsh , rcp and rlogin .

Description:
The telnet package contains the telnet client, which allows users to start connections to
other systems via the telnet protocol.
Rationale:
The telnet protocol is insecure and unencrypted. The use of an unencrypted transmission
medium could allow an unauthorized user to steal credentials. The ssh package provides
an encrypted session and stronger security and is included in most Linux distributions.
Audit:
Verify telnet is not installed. Use the following command to provide the needed

3.1.1 Ensure packet redirect sending is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
ICMP Redirects are used to send routing information to other hosts. As a host itself does
not act as a router (in a host only configuration), there is no need to send redirects.
Rationale:
An attacker could use a compromised host to send invalid ICMP redirects to other router
devices in an attempt to corrupt routing and have users access a system set up by the
attacker as opposed to a valid system.

3.1.2 Ensure IP forwarding is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The net.ipv4.ip_forward and net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding flags are used to tell the
system whether it can forward packets or not.
Rationale:
Setting the flags to 0 ensures that a system with multiple interfaces (for example, a hard
proxy), will never be able to forward packets, and therefore, never serve as a router.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
# grep -E -s "^\s*net\.ipv4\.ip_forward\s*=\s*1" /etc/sysctl.conf

systems. A system acts as a router if it has at least two interfaces and is configured to
perform routing functions.

193 | P a g e

3.2.1 Ensure source routed packets are not accepted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets
take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined
by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from
some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets
would need to be used.
Rationale:
Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route,
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route,
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route and
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from accepting

source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet
routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume
that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice
versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable
addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If,
however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the
private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing
protocols that did not allow this routing.

3.2.2 Ensure ICMP redirects are not accepted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
ICMP redirect messages are packets that convey routing information and tell your host
(acting as a router) to send packets via an alternate path. It is a way of allowing an outside
routing device to update your system routing tables. By setting
net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects and net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects to 0,
the system will not accept any ICMP redirect messages, and therefore, won't allow
outsiders to update the system's routing tables.
Rationale:
Attackers could use bogus ICMP redirect messages to maliciously alter the system routing
tables and get them to send packets to incorrect networks and allow your system packets
to be captured.

3.2.4 Ensure suspicious packets are logged (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
When enabled, this feature logs packets with un-routable source addresses to the kernel

Rationale:
Enabling this feature and logging these packets allows an administrator to investigate the
possibility that an attacker is sending spoofed packets to their system.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians
net.ipv4.conf.default.log_martians = 1

3.2.5 Ensure broadcast ICMP requests are ignored (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Setting net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts to 1 will cause the system to ignore all
ICMP echo and timestamp requests to broadcast and multicast addresses.
Rationale:
Accepting ICMP echo and timestamp requests with broadcast or multicast destinations for
your network could be used to trick your host into starting (or participating) in a Smurf
attack. A Smurf attack relies on an attacker sending large amounts of ICMP broadcast
messages with a spoofed source address. All hosts receiving this message and responding
would send echo-reply messages back to the spoofed address, which is probably not
routable. If many hosts respond to the packets, the amount of traffic on the network could
be significantly multiplied.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts
net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

3.2.6 Ensure bogus ICMP responses are ignored (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Setting icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses to 1 prevents the kernel from logging bogus
responses (RFC-1122 non-compliant) from broadcast reframes, keeping file systems from
filling up with useless log messages.
Rationale:
Some routers (and some attackers) will send responses that violate RFC-1122 and attempt
to fill up a log file system with many useless error messages.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses
net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1

3.2.7 Ensure Reverse Path Filtering is enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter to 1 forces
the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if the
packet was valid. Essentially, with reverse path filtering, if the return packet does not go
out the same interface that the corresponding source packet came from, the packet is
dropped (and logged if log_martians is set).
Rationale:
Setting these flags is a good way to deter attackers from sending your system bogus
packets that cannot be responded to. One instance where this feature breaks down is if
asymmetrical routing is employed. This would occur when using dynamic routing protocols
(bgp, ospf, etc) on your system. If you are using asymmetrical routing on your system, you
will not be able to enable this feature without breaking the routing.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
# sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1

3.2.8 Ensure TCP SYN Cookies is enabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the
half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN
cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the
SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that
encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet
was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake
with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has
received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no
corresponding SYN in the queue.
Rationale:
Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by
sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake. This will quickly
use up slots in the kernel's half-open connection queue and prevent legitimate connections
from succeeding. SYN cookies allow the system to keep accepting valid connections, even if
under a denial of service attack.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
# grep "net\.ipv4\.tcp_syncookies" /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*

3.2.9 Ensure IPv6 router advertisements are not accepted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
This setting disables the system's ability to accept IPv6 router advertisements.
Rationale:
It is recommended that systems do not accept router advertisements as they could be
tricked into routing traffic to compromised machines. Setting hard routes within the
system (usually a single default route to a trusted router) protects the system from bad
routes.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
# sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra
net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra = 0
# sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra
net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra = 0

3.3 TCP Wrappers

214 | P a g e

3.3.1 Ensure TCP Wrappers is installed (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Many Linux distributions provide value-added firewall solutions which provide easy,
advanced management of network traffic into and out of the local system. When these
solutions are available and appropriate for an environment they should be used.
In cases where a value-added firewall is not provided by a distribution, TCP Wrappers
provides a simple access list and standardized logging method for services capable of
supporting it. Services that are called from inetd and xinetd support the use of TCP
wrappers. Any service that can support TCP wrappers will have the libwrap.so library
attached to it.
Rationale:
TCP Wrappers provide a good simple access list mechanism to services that may not have
that support built in. It is recommended that all services that can support TCP Wrappers,
use it.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify TCP Wrappers is installed:
# dpkg -s tcpd

215 | P a g e

Remediation:
Run the following command to install TCP Wrappers:
# apt install tcpd

Impact:
Some Linux distributions have deprecated the use of TCP Wrappers in favor of value-added
firewall solutions. In these cases the provided firewall solution should be used.
Notes:
To verify if a service supports TCP Wrappers, run the following command:
# ldd <path-to-daemon> | grep libwrap.so

If there is any output, then the service supports TCP Wrappers.

References:
1. http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/ufw.8.html
Notes:
When running ufw enable or starting ufw via its initscript, ufw will flush its chains. This is
required so ufw can maintain a consistent state, but it may drop existing connections (eg
ssh). ufw does support adding rules before enabling the firewall.
Run the following command before running ufw enable.
# ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 22

The rules will still be flushed, but the ssh port will be open after enabling the firewall.
Please note that once ufw is 'enabled', ufw will not flush the chains when adding or
removing rules (but will when modifying a rule or changing the default policy).
By default, ufw will prompt when enabling the firewall while running under ssh. This
can be disabled by using ufw --force enable.

Audit:
Run the following command and verify all rules for new outbound connections match site
policy:
# ufw status numbered

238 | P a g e

Remediation:
Configure ufw in accordance with site policy. The following commands will implement a
policy to allow all outbound connections on all interfaces:
# ufw allow out on all

Impact:
To enable connection to patch repositories, the following outbound needs to be
enabled:




DNS port (53) ufw allow out to any port 53
HTTP port (80) ufw allow out to any port 80
HTTPS port (443) ufw allow out to any port 443

Notes:
Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of
the system. Unlike iptables, when a new outbound rule is added, ufw automatically takes
care of associated established connections, so no rules for the latter kind are required.

3.5.3 Configure nftables
nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network
packets/datagrams/frames and is the successor to iptables. The biggest change with the
successor nftables is its simplicity. With iptables, we have to configure every single rule and
use the syntax which can be compared with normal commands. With nftables, the simpler
syntax, much like BPF (Berkely Packet Filter) means shorter lines and less repetition.
Support for nftables should also be compiled into the kernel, together with the related
nftables modules. Please ensure that your kernel supports nf_tables before choosing this
option.
Note: This section broadly assumes starting with an empty nftables firewall ruleset
(established by flushing the rules with nft flush ruleset). Remediation steps included
onlyaffect the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall
configuration to apply on boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a
remote connection will often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good
firewall configuration set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a
script that is then run and tested before saving to boot.
The following will implement the firewall rules of this section and open ICMP, IGMP, and
port 22(ssh) from anywhere. Opening the ports for ICMP, IGMP, and port 22(ssh) needs to
be updated in accordence with local site policy. Allow port 22(ssh) needs to be updated to
only allow systems requiring ssh connectivity to connect, as per site policy.
Save the script bellow as /etc/nftables/nftables.rules

Rationale:
It is possible to mix iptables and nftables. However, this increases complexity and also the
chance to introduce errors. For simplicity flush out all iptables rules, and ensure it is not
loaded
Audit:
Run the following commands to ensure no iptables rules exist
For iptables:

Rationale:
nftables doesn't have any default tables. Without a table being build, nftables will not filter
network traffic.

3.5.3.3 Ensure base chains exist (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Chains are containers for rules. They exist in two kinds, base chains and regular chains. A
base chain is an entry point for packets from the networking stack, a regular chain may be
used as jump target and is used for better rule organization.
Rationale:
If a base chain doesn't exist with a hook for input, forward, and delete, packets that would
flow through those chains will not be touched by nftables.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify that base chains exist for INPUT, FORWARD, and
OUTPUT.
# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook input'
type filter hook input priority 0;
# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook forward'
type filter hook forward priority 0;
# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook output'
type filter hook output priority 0;

250 | P a g e

Run the following command to create the base chains:
# nft create chain inet <table name> <base chain name> { type filter hook

# nft create chain inet filter input { type filter hook input priority 0 \; }
# nft create chain inet filter forward { type filter hook forward priority 0
\; }
# nft create chain inet filter output { type filter hook output priority 0 \;
}

Impact:
if configuring nftables over ssh, creating a base chain with a policy of drop will cause loss
of connectivity.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server

Description:
Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic. Configure all other interfaces to deny

Rationale:
Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically critical to
operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network
traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network as an antispoofing measure.
Audit:
Run the following commands to verify that the loopback interface is configured:
# nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep 'iif "lo" accept'
iif "lo" accept
# nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep 'ip sddr'

Audit:
Run the following commands and verify all rules for established incoming connections
match site policy: site policy:
# nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep -E 'ip protocol

3.5.3.6 Ensure default deny firewall policy (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Base chain policy is the default verdict that will be applied to packets reaching the end of
the chain.
Rationale:
There are two policies: accept (Default) and drop. If the policy is set to accept, the firewall
will accept any packet that is not configured to be denied and the packet will continue
transversing the network stack.
It is easier to white list acceptable usage than to black list unacceptable usage.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify that base chains contain a policy of DROP.
# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook input'
type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop;
# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook forward'
type filter hook forward priority 0; policy drop;
# nft list ruleset | grep 'hook output'
type filter hook output priority 0; policy drop;

256 | P a g e

Remediation:
Run the following command for the base chains with the input, forward, and output hooks
to implement a default DROP policy:
# nft chain <table family> <table name> <chain name> { policy drop \; }

Example:
# nft chain inet filter input { policy drop \; }
# nft chain inet filter forward { policy drop \; }
# nft chain inet filter output { policy drop \; }

Impact:
if configuring nftables over ssh, creating a base chain with a policy of drop will cause loss of
connectivity.
Ensure that a rule allowing ssh has been added to the base chain prior to setting the base
chain's policy to drop

3.5.4 Configure iptables
IPtables is an application that allows a system administrator to configure the IPv4 and IPv6
tables, chains and rules provided by the Linux kernel firewall. While several methods of
configuration exist this section is intended only to ensure the resulting IPtables rules are in
place, not how they are configured. If IPv6 is in use in your environment, similar settings
should be applied to the IP6tables as well.

262 | P a g e

3.5.4.1 Configure IPv4 iptables
Iptables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet filter rules in the
Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of
built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.
Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do
with a packet that matches. This is called a 'target', which may be a jump to a user-defined
chain in the same table.
Note: This section broadly assumes starting with an empty IPtables firewall ruleset
(established by flushing the rules with iptables -F). Remediation steps included only affect
the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to apply
on boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will
often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration
set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run
and tested before saving to boot. The following script will implement the firewall rules of
this section and open port 22(ssh) from anywhere:

3.5.4.2 Configure IPv6 ip6tables
Ip6tables is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv6 packet filter rules in the
Linux kernel. Several different tables may be defined. Each table contains a number of
built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains. Each chain is a list of rules which
can match a set of packets. Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches. This
is called a `target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same table.
If IPv6 in enabled on the system, the ip6tables should be configured.
Note: This section broadly assumes starting with an empty ip6tables firewall ruleset
(established by flushing the rules with ip6tables -F). Remediation steps included only affect
the live system, you will also need to configure your default firewall configuration to apply
on boot. Configuration of a live systems firewall directly over a remote connection will
often result in being locked out. It is advised to have a known good firewall configuration
set to run on boot and to configure an entire firewall structure in a script that is then run
and tested before saving to boot. The following script will implement the firewall rules of
this section and open port 22(ssh) from anywhere:

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
A default deny all policy on connections ensures that any unconfigured network usage will
be rejected.
Rationale:
With a default accept policy the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be

4 Logging and Auditing
The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing,
using tools included in most distributions.
It is recommended that rsyslog be used for logging (with logwatch providing
summarization) and auditd be used for auditing (with aureport providing summarization)
to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.
In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended
that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an
encrypted connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that
may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log
information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker has modified the
local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it
to process the logs described in this section.
Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems
(particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized
among systems and devices connected to the local network.
It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and
correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more
significant when compared to an entry in another log.
Note on log file permissions: There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the
permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators who
are in a defined security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root in
order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have
group permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root.
Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for
systems that do not have a secured group method implemented that only permits root to
read the log files (root:root 600). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are
designated as root:securegrp 640 where securegrp is the defined security group (in
some cases wheel).

289 | P a g e

4.1 Configure System Accounting (auditd)
System auditing, through auditd, allows system administrators to monitor their systems
such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification of data. By default, auditd
will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication
events. Events will be logged to /var/log/audit/audit.log. The recording of these events
will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are
captured, additional on system or off system storage may need to be allocated.
The recommendations in this section implement an audit policy that produces large
quantities of logged data. In some environments it can be challenging to store or process
these logs and as such they are marked as Level 2 for both Servers and Workstations. Note:
For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64
bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is needed.
Note: Several recommendations in this section filter based off of auid>=1000 for
unprivileged non-system users. Some distributions split at UID 500 instead, consult your
documentation and/or the UID_MIN setting in /etc/login.defs to determine which is
appropriate for you.
Note: Once all audit rules have been added to a file or files in the /etc/audit/rules.d/
directory, the auditd service must be re-started, or the system rebooted, for the new rules
to be included.

4.1.2 Configure Data Retention
When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit
logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them.
Older versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may
fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide
guidance, check your site policy for audit storage requirements.

Rationale:
It is important that an appropriate size is determined for log files so that they do not impact
the system and audit data is not lost.
Audit:
Run the following command and ensure output is in compliance with site policy:

4.1.3 Ensure events that modify date and time information are collected
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Capture events where the system date and/or time has been modified. The parameters in
this section are set to determine if the adjtimex (tune kernel clock), settimeofday (Set
time, using timeval and timezone structures) stime (using seconds since 1/1/1970) or
clock_settime (allows for the setting of several internal clocks and timers) system calls
have been executed and always write an audit record to the /var/log/audit.log file upon
exit, tagging the records with the identifier "time-change"
Rationale:
Unexpected changes in system date and/or time could be a sign of malicious activity on the
system.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Record events affecting the group , passwd (user IDs), shadow and gshadow (passwords) or
/etc/security/opasswd (old passwords, based on remember parameter in the PAM
configuration) files. The parameters in this section will watch the files to see if they have
been opened for write or have had attribute changes (e.g. permissions) and tag them with
the identifier "identity" in the audit log file.
Rationale:
Unexpected changes to these files could be an indication that the system has been
compromised and that an unauthorized user is attempting to hide their activities or
compromise additional accounts.

4.1.5 Ensure events that modify the system's network environment are
collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Record changes to network environment files or system calls. The below parameters
monitor the sethostname (set the systems host name) or setdomainname (set the systems
domainname) system calls, and write an audit event on system call exit. The other
parameters monitor the /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net files (messages displayed prelogin), /etc/hosts (file containing host names and associated IP addresses) and
/etc/network (directory containing network interface scripts and configurations) files.
Rationale:
Monitoring sethostname and setdomainname will identify potential unauthorized changes
to host and domainname of a system. The changing of these names could potentially break
security parameters that are set based on those names. The /etc/hosts file is monitored
for changes in the file that can indicate an unauthorized intruder is trying to change
machine associations with IP addresses and trick users and processes into connecting to
unintended machines. Monitoring /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net is important, as
intruders could put disinformation into those files and trick users into providing
information to the intruder. Monitoring /etc/network is important as it can show if
network interfaces or scripts are being modified in a way that can lead to the machine
becoming unavailable or compromised. All audit records will be tagged with the identifier
"system-locale."

Description:
Monitor AppArmor mandatory access controls. The parameters below monitor any write
access (potential additional, deletion or modification of files in the directory) or attribute
changes to /etc/apparmor and /etc/apparmor.d directories.
Rationale:
Changes to files in these directories could indicate that an unauthorized user is attempting
to modify access controls and change security contexts, leading to a compromise of the
system.

file /var/log/lastlog maintain records of the last time a user successfully logged in. The
file /var/log/tallylog maintains records of failures via the pam_tally2 module
Rationale:
Monitoring login/logout events could provide a system administrator with information
associated with brute force attacks against user logins.

4.1.8 Ensure session initiation information is collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor session initiation events. The parameters in this section track changes to the files
associated with session events. The file /var/run/utmp tracks all currently logged in users.
All audit records will be tagged with the identifier "session." The /var/log/wtmp file tracks
logins, logouts, shutdown, and reboot events. The file /var/log/btmp keeps track of failed
login attempts and can be read by entering the command /usr/bin/last -f
/var/log/btmp . All audit records will be tagged with the identifier "logins."
Rationale:
Monitoring these files for changes could alert a system administrator to logins occurring at
unusual hours, which could indicate intruder activity (i.e. a user logging in at a time when
they do not normally log in).
Audit:
Run the following commands:
# grep -E '(session|logins)' /etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules

Verify output includes:

4.1.9 Ensure discretionary access control permission modification events
are collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor changes to file permissions, attributes, ownership and group. The parameters in
this section track changes for system calls that affect file permissions and attributes. The
chmod , fchmod and fchmodat system calls affect the permissions associated with a file. The
chown , fchown , fchownat and lchown system calls affect owner and group attributes on a
file. The setxattr , lsetxattr , fsetxattr (set extended file attributes) and removexattr ,
lremovexattr , fremovexattr (remove extended file attributes) control extended file
attributes. In all cases, an audit record will only be written for non-system user ids (auid >=
1000) and will ignore Daemon events (auid = 4294967295). All audit records will be
tagged with the identifier "perm_mod."
Note: Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN. To confirm the
UID_MIN for your system, run the following command:
awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs

If your systems' UID_MIN is not 1000, replace audit>=1000 with audit>=<UID_MIN for
your system> in the Audit and Remediation procedures.
Rationale:
Monitoring for changes in file attributes could alert a system administrator to activity that
could indicate intruder activity or policy violation.

collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor for unsuccessful attempts to access files. The parameters below are associated
with system calls that control creation ( creat ), opening ( open , openat ) and truncation (
truncate , ftruncate ) of files. An audit log record will only be written if the user is a nonprivileged user (auid > = 1000), is not a Daemon event (auid=4294967295) and if the
system call returned EACCES (permission denied to the file) or EPERM (some other
permanent error associated with the specific system call). All audit records will be tagged
with the identifier "access."
Note: Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN. To confirm the
UID_MIN for your system, run the following command:
# awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs

If your systems' UID_MIN is not 1000, replace audit>=1000 with audit>=<UID_MIN for your

4.1.11 Ensure use of privileged commands is collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor privileged programs (those that have the setuid and/or setgid bit set on execution)
to determine if unprivileged users are running these commands.
Note: Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN. To confirm the
UID_MIN for your system, run the following command:
# awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs

If your systems' UID_MIN is not 1000, replace audit>=1000 with audit>=<UID_MIN for your
system> in the Audit and Remediation procedures.
Rationale:
Execution of privileged commands by non-privileged users could be an indication of
someone trying to gain unauthorized access to the system.
Audit:
Run the following command replacing <partition> with a list of partitions where
programs can be executed from on your system:
# find <partition> -xdev \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f | awk
'{print \
"-a always,exit -F path=" $1 " -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 \
-k privileged" }'

Verify all resulting lines are a .rules file in /etc/audit/rules.d/ and the output of
auditctl -l.
NOTE: The .rules file output will be auid!=-1 not auid!=4294967295

325 | P a g e

Remediation:
To remediate this issue, the system administrator will have to execute a find command to
locate all the privileged programs and then add an audit line for each one of them. The
audit parameters associated with this are as follows:
-F path=" $1 " - will populate each file name found through the find command and
processed by awk. -F perm=x - will write an audit record if the file is executed. -F
auid>=1000 - will write a record if the user executing the command is not a privileged user.
-F auid!= 4294967295 - will ignore Daemon events
All audit records should be tagged with the identifier "privileged".
Run the following command replacing with a list of partitions where programs can be
executed from on your system:
# find <partition> -xdev \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f | awk
'{print \
"-a always,exit -F path=" $1 " -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 \
-k privileged" }'

Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/ directory ending in .rules
Example: vi /etc/audit/rules.d/privileged.rules
And add all resulting lines to the file.

4.1.12 Ensure successful file system mounts are collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount ) system call controls the
mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to
create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user
Note: Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN. To confirm the
UID_MIN for your system, run the following command:
# awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs

If your systems' UID_MIN is not 1000, replace audit>=1000 with audit>=<UID_MIN for your
system> in the Audit and Remediation procedures.
Rationale:
It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While
tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media
may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's
an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the
media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also
have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a
file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair
indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track
successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the
audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track
data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.

4.1.13 Ensure file deletion events by users are collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor the use of system calls associated with the deletion or renaming of files and file
attributes. This configuration statement sets up monitoring for the unlink (remove a file),
unlinkat (remove a file attribute), rename (rename a file) and renameat (rename a file
attribute) system calls and tags them with the identifier "delete".
Note: Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN. To confirm the
UID_MIN for your system, run the following command:
# awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs

If your systems' UID_MIN is not 1000, replace audit>=1000 with audit>=<UID_MIN for your
system> in the Audit and Remediation procedures.
Rationale:
Monitoring these calls from non-privileged users could provide a system administrator
with evidence that inappropriate removal of files and file attributes associated with
protected files is occurring. While this audit option will look at all events, system
administrators will want to look for specific privileged files that are being deleted or
altered.

4.1.14 Ensure changes to system administration scope (sudoers) is

Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor scope changes for system administrations. If the system has been properly
configured to force system administrators to log in as themselves first and then use the
sudo command to execute privileged commands, it is possible to monitor changes in scope.
The file /etc/sudoers will be written to when the file or its attributes have changed. The

Rationale:
Changes in the /etc/sudoers file can indicate that an unauthorized change has been made
to scope of system administrator activity.

4.1.15 Ensure system administrator actions (sudolog) are collected
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor the sudo log file. If the system has been properly configured to disable the use of
the su command and force all administrators to have to log in first and then use sudo to
execute privileged commands, then all administrator commands will be logged to
/var/log/sudo.log . Any time a command is executed, an audit event will be triggered as
the /var/log/sudo.log file will be opened for write and the executed administration
command will be written to the log.
Rationale:
Changes in /var/log/sudo.log indicate that an administrator has executed a command or
the log file itself has been tampered with. Administrators will want to correlate the events
written to the audit trail with the records written to /var/log/sudo.log to verify if
unauthorized commands have been executed.
Audit:
Run the following commands:
# grep -E "^\s*-w\s+$(grep -r logfile /etc/sudoers* | sed -e
's/.*logfile=//;s/,? .*//')\s+-p\s+wa\s+-k\s+actions"
/etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules
# auditctl -l | grep actions

Verify output of both matches the output of the following command, and the the output
includes a file path
echo "-w $(grep -r logfile /etc/sudoers* | sed -e 's/.*logfile=//;s/,? .*//')
-p wa -k actions"

Example Output
-w /var/log/sudo.log -p wa -k actions

and add the following line:
-w /var/log/sudo.log -p wa -k actions

Notes:
The system must be configured with su disabled (See Item 5.6 Ensure access to the su
command is restricted) to force all command execution through sudo. This will not be
effective on the console, as administrators can log in as root.

4.1.16 Ensure kernel module loading and unloading is collected (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
Monitor the loading and unloading of kernel modules. The programs insmod (install a
kernel module), rmmod (remove a kernel module), and modprobe (a more sophisticated
program to load and unload modules, as well as some other features) control loading and
unloading of modules. The init_module (load a module) and delete_module (delete a
module) system calls control loading and unloading of modules. Any execution of the
loading and unloading module programs and system calls will trigger an audit record with
an identifier of "modules".
Rationale:
Monitoring the use of insmod , rmmod and modprobe could provide system administrators
with evidence that an unauthorized user loaded or unloaded a kernel module, possibly
compromising the security of the system. Monitoring of the init_module and
delete_module system calls would reflect an unauthorized user attempting to use a
different program to load and unload modules.

4.2.1.5 Ensure rsyslog is configured to send logs to a remote log host
(Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The rsyslog utility supports the ability to send logs it gathers to a remote log host running
syslogd(8) or to receive messages from remote hosts, reducing administrative overhead.
Rationale:
Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker
gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is
stored on the local system
Audit:
Review the /etc/rsyslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf files and verify that logs are
sent to a central host.
# grep -E "^[^#](\s*\S+\s*)\s*action\(" /etc/rsyslog.conf
/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf | grep "target="

Output should include target=<FQDN or IP of remote loghost>
OR
# grep -E "^[^#]\s*\S+\.\*\s+@" /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf

Output should include either the FQDN or the IP of the remote loghost

4.2.1.6 Ensure remote rsyslog messages are only accepted on
designated log hosts. (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
By default, rsyslog does not listen for log messages coming in from remote systems. The
ModLoad tells rsyslog to load the imtcp.so module so it can listen over a network via TCP.
The InputTCPServerRun option instructs rsyslogd to listen on the specified TCP port.
Rationale:
The guidance in the section ensures that remote log hosts are configured to only accept
rsyslog data from hosts within the specified domain and that those systems that are not
designed to be log hosts do not accept any remote rsyslog messages. This provides
protection from spoofed log data and ensures that system administrators are reviewing
reasonably complete syslog data in a central location.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify the resulting lines are uncommented on
designated log hosts and commented or removed on all others:
# grep '$ModLoad imtcp' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
$ModLoad imtcp
# grep '$InputTCPServerRun' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf

Remediation:
For hosts that are designated as log hosts, edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and uncomment or add the following lines:

For hosts that are not designated as log hosts, edit the /etc/rsyslog.conf file and
comment or remove the following lines:
# $ModLoad imtcp

4.2.2.1 Ensure journald is configured to send logs to rsyslog (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server.
Utilities exist to accept remote export of journald logs, however, use of the rsyslog service
provides a consistent means of log collection and export.
Rationale:
Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker
gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is
stored on the local system.
Audit:

Notes:
This recommendation assumes that recommendation 4.2.1.5, "Ensure rsyslog is configured
to send logs to a remote log host" has been implemented.
As noted in the journald man pages, journald logs may be exported to rsyslog either
through the process mentioned here, or through a facility like systemd-journald.service.
There are trade-offs involved in each implementation, where ForwardToSyslog will
immediately capture all events (and forward to an external log server, if properly
configured), but may not capture all boot-up activities. Mechanisms such as systemdjournald.service, on the other hand, will record bootup events, but may delay sending
the information to rsyslog, leading to the potential for log manipulation prior to export. Be
aware of the limitations of all tools employed to secure a system.

Description:
The journald system includes the capability of compressing overly large files to avoid filling
up the system with logs or making the logs unmanageably large.
Rationale:
Uncompressed large files may unexpectedly fill a filesystem leading to resource
unavailability. Compressing logs prior to write can prevent sudden, unexpected filesystem
impacts.

Writing log data to disk will provide the ability to forensically reconstruct events which
may have impacted the operations or security of a system even after a system crash or
reboot.

use at and cron. By removing the files, only users in /etc/cron.allow and /etc/at.allow
are allowed to use at and cron. Note that even though a given user is not listed in
cron.allow , cron jobs can still be run as that user. The cron.allow file only controls
administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs.
Rationale:
On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule cron jobs. Using
the cron.allow file to control who can run cron jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to

5.2.4 Ensure SSH Protocol is not set to 1 (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Older versions of SSH support two different and incompatible protocols: SSH1 and SSH2.
SSH1 was the original protocol and was subject to security issues. SSH2 is more advanced
and secure.
Rationale:
SSH v1 suffers from insecurities that do not affect SSH v2.
Audit:
Run the following command:
# sshd -T | grep -Ei '^\s*protocol\s+(1|1\s*,\s*2|2\s*,\s*1)\s*'

Nothing should be returned

Protocol 2

Notes:
This command not longer exists in newer versions of SSH. This check is still being included
for systems that may be running an older version of SSH. As of openSSH version 7.4 this

5.2.5 Ensure SSH LogLevel is appropriate (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
INFO level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations,

such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active
on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps
narrow the field.
VERBOSE level specifies that login and logout activity as well as the key fingerprint for any

SSH key used for login will be logged. This information is important for SSH key
management, especially in legacy environments.
Rationale:
SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. DEBUG is specifically
not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides
so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep loglevel
LogLevel VERBOSE

OR
loglevel INFO

392 | P a g e

Remediation:

5.2.6 Ensure SSH X11 forwarding is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Workstation
 Level 2 - Server
Description:
The X11Forwarding parameter provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic through the
connection to enable remote graphic connections.
Rationale:
Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11 applications
directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are logged in via
SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by other users on the X11 server. Note
that even if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their own forwarders.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep x11forwarding
X11Forwarding no

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:
X11Forwarding no

5.2.7 Ensure SSH MaxAuthTries is set to 4 or less (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The MaxAuthTries parameter specifies the maximum number of authentication attempts
permitted per connection. When the login failure count reaches half the number, error
messages will be written to the syslog file detailing the login failure.
Rationale:
Setting the MaxAuthTries parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful
brute force attacks to the SSH server. While the recommended setting is 4, set the number
based on site policy.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output MaxAuthTries is 4 or less:
# sshd -T | grep maxauthtries
MaxAuthTries 4

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:
MaxAuthTries 4

Description:
The IgnoreRhosts parameter specifies that .rhosts and .shosts files will not be used in
RhostsRSAAuthentication or HostbasedAuthentication.
Rationale:
Setting this parameter forces users to enter a password when authenticating with ssh.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep ignorerhosts
IgnoreRhosts yes

5.2.9 Ensure SSH HostbasedAuthentication is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The HostbasedAuthentication parameter specifies if authentication is allowed through
trusted hosts via the user of .rhosts, or /etc/hosts.equiv, along with successful public
key client host authentication. This option only applies to SSH Protocol Version 2.
Rationale:
Even though the .rhosts files are ineffective if support is disabled in /etc/pam.conf,
disabling the ability to use .rhosts files in SSH provides an additional layer of protection.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep hostbasedauthentication
HostbasedAuthentication no

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:
HostbasedAuthentication no

Default Value:

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The PermitRootLogin parameter specifies if the root user can log in using ssh. The default
is no.
Rationale:
Disallowing root logins over SSH requires system admins to authenticate using their own
individual account, then escalating to root via sudo or su. This in turn limits opportunity for
non-repudiation and provides a clear audit trail in the event of a security incident
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep permitrootlogin
PermitRootLogin no

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:
PermitRootLogin no

Default Value:
PermitRootLogin without-password
CIS Controls:

Description:
The PermitEmptyPasswords parameter specifies if the SSH server allows login to accounts
with empty password strings.
Rationale:
Disallowing remote shell access to accounts that have an empty password reduces the
probability of unauthorized access to the system
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep permitemptypasswords
PermitEmptyPasswords no

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:
PermitEmptyPasswords no

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The PermitUserEnvironment option allows users to present environment options to the
ssh daemon.
Rationale:
Permitting users the ability to set environment variables through the SSH daemon could
potentially allow users to bypass security controls (e.g. setting an execution path that has
ssh executing trojan'd programs)
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep permituserenvironment

5.2.13 Ensure only strong Ciphers are used (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
This variable limits the ciphers that SSH can use during communication.
Rationale:
Weak ciphers that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module cannot be relied
upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and system data may be compromised
The DES, Triple DES, and Blowfish ciphers, as used in SSH, have a birthday bound of
approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain
cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, aka a
"Sweet32" attack
The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not properly
combine state data with key data during the initialization phase, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks against the initial bytes of a stream
by sniffing network traffic that occasionally relies on keys affected by the Invariance
Weakness, and then using a brute-force approach involving LSB values, aka the "Bar
Mitzvah" issue
The passwords used during an SSH session encrypted with RC4 can be recovered by an
attacker who is able to capture and replay the session
Error handling in the SSH protocol; Client and Server, when using a block cipher algorithm
in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover
certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in an SSH session via unknown
vectors
The mm_newkeys_from_blob function in monitor_wrap.c, when an AES-GCM cipher is used,
does not properly initialize memory for a MAC context data structure, which allows remote
authenticated users to bypass intended ForceCommand and login-shell restrictions via
packet data that provides a crafted callback address

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
This variable limits the types of MAC algorithms that SSH can use during communication.
Rationale:
MD5 and 96-bit MAC algorithms are considered weak and have been shown to increase
exploitability in SSH downgrade attacks. Weak algorithms continue to have a great deal of
attention as a weak spot that can be exploited with expanded computing power. An
attacker that breaks the algorithm could take advantage of a MiTM position to decrypt the
SSH tunnel and capture credentials and information

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged
between two parties, allowing use of a cryptographic algorithm. If the sender and receiver
wish to exchange encrypted messages, each must be equipped to encrypt messages to be
sent and decrypt messages received
Rationale:
Key exchange methods that are considered weak should be removed. A key exchange
method may be weak because too few bits are used, or the hashing algorithm is considered
too weak. Using weak algorithms could expose connections to man-in-the-middle attacks
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output does not contain any of the listed weak

5.2.16 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of
ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no
activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax
variable is set, sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval.
When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the
client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15
seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated
after 45 seconds of idle time.
Rationale:
Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user
access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't
lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening..
While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on
site policy. The recommended setting for ClientAliveCountMax is 0. In this case, the client
session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be
sent.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify ClientAliveInterval is between 1 and 300 and
ClientAliveCountMax is 3 or less:
# sshd -T | grep clientaliveinterval
ClientAliveInterval 300
# sshd -T | grep clientalivecountmax
ClientAliveCountMax 0

5.2.17 Ensure SSH LoginGraceTime is set to one minute or less (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The LoginGraceTime parameter specifies the time allowed for successful authentication to
the SSH server. The longer the Grace period is the more open unauthenticated connections
can exist. Like other session controls in this session the Grace Period should be limited to
appropriate organizational limits to ensure the service is available for needed access.
Rationale:
Setting the LoginGraceTime parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful
brute force attacks to the SSH server. It will also limit the number of concurrent
unauthenticated connections While the recommended setting is 60 seconds (1 Minute), set
the number based on site policy.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output LoginGraceTime is between 1 and 60:
# sshd -T | grep logingracetime

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
There are several options available to limit which users and group can access the system
via SSH. It is recommended that at least one of the following options be leveraged:
AllowUsers

The AllowUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific
users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated user names. Numeric user
IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user
access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host, the entry
can be specified in the form of user@host.
AllowGroups

The AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific
groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated group names.
Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.
DenyUsers

The DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific users
to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated user names. Numeric user IDs
are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user
access further by specifically denying a user's access from a particular host, the entry can
be specified in the form of user@host.
DenyGroups

The DenyGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific
groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated group names.
Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable.
Rationale:
Restricting which users can remotely access the system via SSH will help ensure that only
authorized users access the system.

5.2.21 Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client
to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy
applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals
use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines
Rationale:
Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors.
SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible
to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries
considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration.
Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications,
or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that output matches:
# sshd -T | grep -i allowtcpforwarding
AllowTcpForwarding no

420 | P a g e

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:

Description:
Lock out users after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts. The first sets of changes are
made to the PAM configuration files. The second set of changes are applied to the program
specific PAM configuration file. The second set of changes must be applied to each program
that will lock out users. Check the documentation for each secondary program for

audit - Will log the user name into the system log if the user is not found.
silent - Don't print informative messages.

Set the lockout number and unlock time in accordance with local site policy.
Rationale:
Locking out user IDs after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts mitigates brute force
password attacks against your systems.

Note: If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive
failure count defined by deny= in the pam_tally2.so module, the user can be unlocked by
issuing the command /sbin/pam_tally2 -u <username> --reset. This command sets the
failed count to 0, effectively unlocking the user.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The commands below change password encryption from md5 to sha512 (a much stronger
hashing algorithm). All existing accounts will need to perform a password change to
upgrade the stored hashes to the new algorithm.
Rationale:
The SHA-512 algorithm provides much stronger hashing than MD5, thus providing
additional protection to the system by increasing the level of effort for an attacker to
successfully determine passwords.
Note that these change only apply to accounts configured on the local system.
Audit:
Run the following commands and ensure the sha512 option is included in all results:
# grep -E
'^\s*password\s+(\S+\s+)+pam_unix\.so\s+(\S+\s+)*sha512\s*(\S+\s*)*(\s+#.*)?$

Notes:
Consult your documentation for the appropriate PAM file and module.
Additional module options may be set, recommendation only covers those listed here.
If it is determined that the password algorithm being used is not SHA-512, once it is
changed, it is recommended that all user ID's be immediately expired and forced to change
their passwords on next login. To accomplish that, the following commands can be used.
Any system accounts that need to be expired should be carefully done separately by the
system administrator to prevent any potential problems.
# awk -F: '( $3 >= $(awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs) && $1 !=

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to force
passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. It is recommended that the
PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter be set to less than or equal to 365 days.
Rationale:
The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or
successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of
the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an
attacker's window of opportunity.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify PASS_MAX_DAYS conforms to site policy (no more
than 365 days):
# grep PASS_MAX_DAYS /etc/login.defs
PASS_MAX_DAYS 365

Run the following command and Review list of users and PASS_MAX_DAYS to verify that all
users' PASS_MAX_DAYS conforms to site policy (no more than 365 days):

users from changing their password until a minimum number of days have passed since the
last time the user changed their password. It is recommended that PASS_MIN_DAYS
parameter be set to 1 or more days.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The PASS_WARN_AGE parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to notify users
that their password will expire in a defined number of days. It is recommended that the
PASS_WARN_AGE parameter be set to 7 or more days.
Rationale:
Providing an advance warning that a password will be expiring gives users time to think of

5.4.1.4 Ensure inactive password lock is 30 days or less (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
User accounts that have been inactive for over a given period of time can be automatically
disabled. It is recommended that accounts that are inactive for 30 days after password
expiration be disabled.
Rationale:
Inactive accounts pose a threat to system security since the users are not logging in to
notice failed login attempts or other anomalies.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify INACTIVE conforms to sire policy (no more than 30
days):
# useradd -D | grep INACTIVE
INACTIVE=30

Verify all users with a password have Password inactive no more than 30 days after
password expires:
Run the following command and Review list of users and INACTIVE to verify that all users'
INACTIVE conforms to site policy (no more than 30 days):
# grep -E ^[^:]+:[^\!*] /etc/shadow | cut -d: -f1,7
<user>:<INACTIVE>

# chage --inactive 30 <user>

Notes:
You can also check this setting in /etc/shadow directly. The 7th field should be 30 or less

All users should have a password change date in the past.
Rationale:
If a users recorded password change date is in the future then they could bypass any set

5.4.2 Ensure system accounts are secured (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
There are a number of accounts provided with most distributions that are used to manage
applications and are not intended to provide an interactive shell.
Rationale:
It is important to make sure that accounts that are not being used by regular users are
prevented from being used to provide an interactive shell. By default, most distributions
set the password field for these accounts to an invalid string, but it is also recommended
that the shell field in the password file be set to the nologin shell. This prevents the
account from potentially being used to run any commands.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify no results are returned:
awk -F: '($1!="root" && $1!="sync" && $1!="shutdown" && $1!="halt" &&
$1!~/^\+/ && $3<'"$(awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs)"' &&
$7!="'"$(which nologin)"'" && $7!="/bin/false") {print}' /etc/passwd
awk -F: '($1!="root" && $1!~/^\+/ && $3<'"$(awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}'
/etc/login.defs)"') {print $1}' /etc/passwd | xargs -I '{}' passwd -S '{}' |
awk '($2!="L" && $2!="LK") {print $1}'

445 | P a g e

Remediation:
Run the commands appropriate for your distribution:
Set the shell for any accounts returned by the audit to nologin:
# usermod -s $(which nologin) <user>

Lock any non root accounts returned by the audit:
# usermod -L <user>

The following command will set all system accounts to a non login shell:
awk -F: '($1!="root" && $1!="sync" && $1!="shutdown" && $1!="halt" &&
$1!~/^\+/ && $3<'"$(awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}' /etc/login.defs)"' &&
$7!="'"$(which nologin)"'" && $7!="/bin/false") {print $1}' /etc/passwd |
while read -r user; do usermod -s "$(which nologin)" "$user"; done

The following command will automatically lock not root system accounts:
awk -F: '($1!="root" && $1!~/^\+/ && $3<'"$(awk '/^\s*UID_MIN/{print $2}'
/etc/login.defs)"') {print $1}' /etc/passwd | xargs -I '{}' passwd -S '{}' |
awk '($2!="L" && $2!="LK") {print $1}' | while read -r user; do usermod -L
"$user"; done

Notes:
The root, sync, shutdown, and halt users are exempted from requiring a non-login shell.

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The usermod command can be used to specify which group the root user belongs to. This
affects permissions of files that are created by the root user.
Rationale:
Using GID 0 for the root account helps prevent root -owned files from accidentally
becoming accessible to non-privileged users.

5.4.4 Ensure default user umask is 027 or more restrictive (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The default umask determines the permissions of files created by users. The user creating
the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the
chmod command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by
others by default may choose a different default umask by inserting the umask command
into the standard shell configuration files ( .profile , .bashrc , etc.) in their home
directories.
Rationale:
Setting a very secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice
about their file permissions. A default umask setting of 077 causes files and directories
created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system. A umask of 027 would
make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a umask of 022
would make files readable by every user on the system.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify all umask lines returned are 027 or more
restrictive.
# grep "umask" /etc/bash.bashrc
umask 027
# grep "umask" /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/*.sh
umask 027

448 | P a g e

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/bash.bashrc, /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d/*.sh files (and the
appropriate files for any other shell supported on your system) and add or edit any umask
parameters as follows:
umask 027

Notes:
The audit and remediation in this recommendation apply to bash and shell. If other shells
are supported on the system, it is recommended that their configuration files also are
checked.
Other methods of setting a default user umask exist however the shell configuration files
are the last run and will override other settings if they exist therefor our recommendation
is to configure in the shell configuration files. If other methods are in use in your
environment they should be audited and the shell configs should be verified to not
override.

5.4.5 Ensure default user shell timeout is 900 seconds or less (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The default TMOUT determines the shell timeout for users. The TMOUT value is measured in
seconds.
Rationale:
Having no timeout value associated with a shell could allow an unauthorized user access to
another user's shell session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the
screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify all TMOUT lines returned are 900 or less and at
least one exists in each file.
# grep -E -i "^\s*(\S+\s+)*TMOUT=(900|[1-8][0-9][0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|[19])\s*(\S+\s*)*(\s+#.*)?$" /etc/bash.bashrc

# grep -E -i "^\s*(\S+\s+)*TMOUT=(900|[1-8][0-9][0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|[19])\s*(\S+\s*)*(\s+#.*)?$" /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/*.sh
readonly TMOUT=900 ; export TMOUT

450 | P a g e

Remediation:
Edit the /etc/bashrc, /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d/*.sh files (and the appropriate
files for any other shell supported on your system) and add or edit any TMOUT parameters
in accordance with site policy:
readonly TMOUT=900 ; export TMOUT

Note: setting the value to readonly prevents unwanted modification during runtime.
Notes:
The audit and remediation in this recommendation apply to bash and shell. If other shells
are supported on the system, it is recommended that their configuration files also are
checked. Other methods of setting a timeout exist for other shells not covered here.
Ensure that the timeout conforms to your local policy.

5.6 Ensure access to the su command is restricted (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program
has been superseded by sudo , which allows for more granular control over privileged
access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the
pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su , the su command will only allow users in a
specific groups to execute su. This group should be empty to reinforce the use of sudo for
privileged access.
Rationale:
Restricting the use of su , and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better
control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility
also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed
via sudo , whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify the output matches the line:
# grep pam_wheel.so /etc/pam.d/su
auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid group=<group_name>

Run the following command and verify that the group specified in <group_name> contains
no users:
# grep <group_name> /etc/group
<group_name>:x:<GID>:

There should be no users listed after the Group ID field.

453 | P a g e

Remediation:
Create an empty group that will be specified for use of the su command. The group should
be named according to site policy.

6.1.1 Audit system file permissions (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 2 - Server
 Level 2 - Workstation
Description:
The Ubuntu package manager has a number of useful options. One of these, the --verify
option, can be used to verify that system packages are correctly installed. The --verify
option can be used to verify a particular package or to verify all system packages. If no
output is returned, the package is installed correctly. The following table describes the
meaning of output from the verify option:
Code

Meaning

S

File size differs.

M

File mode differs (includes permissions and file type).

5

The MD5 checksum differs.

D

The major and minor version numbers differ on a device file.

L

A mismatch occurs in a link.

U

The file ownership differs.

G

The file group owner differs.

T

The file time (mtime) differs.

The dpkg -S command can be used to determine which package a particular file belongs to.
For example the following command determines which package the /bin/bash file belongs
to:
# dpkg -S /bin/bash

bash: /bin/bash

457 | P a g e

To verify the settings for the package that controls the /bin/bash file, run the following:
# dpkg --verify bash

??5?????? c /etc/bash.bashrc

Rationale:
It is important to confirm that packaged system files and directories are maintained with
the permissions they were intended to have from the OS vendor.
Audit:
Run the following command to review all installed packages. Note that this may be very
time consuming and may be best scheduled via the cron utility. It is recommended that the
output of this command be redirected to a file that can be reviewed later.
# dpkg --verify <package name>

Remediation:
Correct any discrepancies found and rerun the audit until output is clean or risk is
mitigated or accepted.
Notes:
Since packages and important files may change with new updates and releases, it is
recommended to verify everything, not just a finite list of files. This can be a time
consuming task and results may depend on site policy therefore it is not a scorable
benchmark item, but is provided for those interested in additional security measures.
Some of the recommendations of this benchmark alter the state of files audited by this
recommendation. The audit command will alert for all changes to a file permissions even if
the new state is more secure than the default.

Description:
The /etc/shadow file is used to store the information about user accounts that is critical to
the security of those accounts, such as the hashed password and other security

Rationale:
If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a password

Description:
Unix-based systems support variable settings to control access to files. World writable files
are the least secure. See the chmod(2) man page for more information.
Rationale:
Data in world-writable files can be modified and compromised by any user on the system.

Sometimes when administrators delete users or groups from the system they neglect to
remove all files owned by those users or groups.
Rationale:
A new user who is assigned the deleted user's user ID or group ID may then end up
"owning" these files, and thus have more access on the system than was intended.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify no files are returned:
# df --local -P | awk '{if (NR!=1) print $6}' | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev
-nogroup

The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items
on network mounted partitions. Additionally the --local option to df is not universal to all
versions, it can be omitted to search all filesystems on a system including network mounted
filesystems or the following command can be run manually for each partition:
# find <partition> -xdev -nogroup

6.1.13 Audit SUID executables (Not Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's
permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the
group. The most common reason for a SUID program is to enable users to perform
functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges.
Rationale:
There are valid reasons for SUID programs, but it is important to identify and review such
programs to ensure they are legitimate.
Audit:
Run the following command to list SUID files:
# df --local -P | awk '{if (NR!=1) print $6}' | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev
-type f -perm -4000

The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items
on network mounted partitions. Additionally the --local option to df is not universal to all

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The owner of a file can set the file's permissions to run with the owner's or group's
permissions, even if the user running the program is not the owner or a member of the
group. The most common reason for a SGID program is to enable users to perform
functions (such as changing their password) that require root privileges.
Rationale:
There are valid reasons for SGID programs, but it is important to identify and review such
programs to ensure they are legitimate. Review the files returned by the action in the audit
section and check to see if system binaries have a different md5 checksum than what from
the package. This is an indication that the binary may have been replaced.
Audit:
Run the following command to list SGID files:
# df --local -P | awk '{if (NR!=1) print $6}' | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev
-type f -perm -2000

The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items

6.2.1 Ensure password fields are not empty (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
An account with an empty password field means that anybody may log in as that user
without providing a password.
Rationale:
All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by
an unauthorized user.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that no output is returned:
# awk -F: '($2 == "" ) { print $1 " does not have a password "}' /etc/shadow

Remediation:
If any accounts in the /etc/shadow file do not have a password, run the following command
to lock the account until it can be determined why it does not have a password:
# passwd -l <username>

Also, check to see if the account is logged in and investigate what it is being used for to
determine if it needs to be forced off.

Description:
Users can be defined in /etc/passwd without a home directory or with a home directory
that does not actually exist.
Rationale:
If the user's home directory does not exist or is unassigned, the user will be placed in "/"
and will not be able to write any files or have local environment variables set.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:

Description:
Any account with UID 0 has superuser privileges on the system.
Rationale:
This access must be limited to only the default root account and only from the system
console. Administrative access must be through an unprivileged account using an approved
mechanism as noted in Item 5.6 Ensure access to the su command is restricted.
Audit:
Run the following command and verify that only "root" is returned:

Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The root user can execute any command on the system and could be fooled into executing
programs unintentionally if the PATH is not set correctly.
Rationale:
Including the current working directory (.) or other writable directory in root 's executable
path makes it likely that an attacker can gain superuser access by forcing an administrator
operating as root to execute a Trojan horse program.

Description:
The .netrc file contains data for logging into a remote host for file transfers via FTP.
Rationale:
The .netrc file presents a significant security risk since it stores passwords in unencrypted

cut -d: -f3 /etc/group | sort | uniq -d | while read x ; do
echo "Duplicate GID ($x) in /etc/group"
done

Remediation:
Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique GIDs and review all files owned by
the shared GID to determine which group they are supposed to belong to.
Notes:
You can also use the grpck command to check for other inconsistencies in the /etc/group
file.

6.2.18 Ensure no duplicate user names exist (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
Although the useradd program will not let you create a duplicate user name, it is possible
for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/passwd file and change the user name.
Rationale:
If a user is assigned a duplicate user name, it will create and have access to files with the
first UID for that username in /etc/passwd . For example, if "test4" has a UID of 1000 and a
subsequent "test4" entry has a UID of 2000, logging in as "test4" will use UID 1000.
Effectively, the UID is shared, which is a security problem.
Audit:
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
#!/bin/bash
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd | sort | uniq -d | while read -r usr; do
echo "Duplicate login name \"$usr\" in /etc/passwd"
done

Remediation:
Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique user names for the users. File
ownerships will automatically reflect the change as long as the users have unique UIDs.

Remediation:
Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique names for the user groups. File
group ownerships will automatically reflect the change as long as the groups have unique
GIDs.

6.2.20 Ensure shadow group is empty (Scored)
Profile Applicability:
 Level 1 - Server
 Level 1 - Workstation
Description:
The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability to read the
/etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group.
Rationale:
Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow
file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a password
cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security information
that is stored in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert
additional user accounts.
Audit:
Run the following commands and verify no results are returned:
# grep ^shadow:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]+ /etc/group
# awk -F: '($4 == "<shadow-gid>") { print }' /etc/passwd

Remediation:
Remove all users from the shadow group, and change the primary group of any users with
shadow as their primary group.

14.6 Protect Information through Access Control Lists
Protect all information stored on systems with file system, network share, claims,
application, or database specific access control lists. These controls will enforce the
principle that only authorized individuals should have access to the information based on
their need to access the information as a part of their responsibilities.
