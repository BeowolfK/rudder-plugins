Here we build the configurations files which will be used by the target CIS
plugin.

The idea is to split the generation for each OS. Which mean that:

* Each OS will contains dedicated Rules/Directives
* Techniques/Generic methods will stay in common
* This build must take care of the naming and tagging of each object


To add a new OS:

* Create appropriate folder here, with the tree:
+
----
ubuntu18
├── directives
│   ├── 0146f6f9-040f-4c3d-9001-0f2bc165b6c1.json  # Directives used
│   ├── 0149c383-7e2d-4dc8-b056-c13bce96593c.json
│   ├── ...
└── rules
    └── ubuntu18.json                              # Rule file
----
* GM and Techniques are commons and must go under the `./configuration` folder
* Add pdfs download to the Makefile
* Add target to Makefile
* In order to avoid id conflict, remove all id from your directives with:
+
----
# Modify the script to setup correct path to change
./tools/resetId
----
* Check that there is no conflict id with:
+
----
find . -type f -printf '%f\n' | sort | uniq -c
----
* To help detect breaking change, try to make/update the <os_folder>/item_list file
+----
./tools/parsePDF pdfs/<pdf to test> > item_list.new
# And compare the new list to the old one
----
